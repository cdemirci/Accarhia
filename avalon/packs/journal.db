To make movement and token placement ideal, we have adjusted the grid on some of the maps so that tokens are easier to select and manipulate. Listed below are all the maps in this module and what scale they are currently set at. We also include instructions on how change the grid if you want to follow a closely accurate strategic method of combat. With the latter, we recommend moving the tokens with the arrow keys instead of the mouse due to the small token size. With the adjusted maps, we tried to keep the tokens size relative, so a large creature is larger than a medium creature and so on.<br /><hr />\n<h3>Non-Square Gridded Maps</h3>\nThese maps do not have a square grid, but are sized so that if you use the <strong>Measurement Tool</strong>, it will count the correct distance length.<br /><br /><strong>Non-Gridded Maps<strong> in <em>Curse of Strahd</em></strong></strong><br />\n<ul>\n<li>Barovia</li>\n<li>Town of Vallaki</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h3>100 Foot Maps</h3>\nEach grid square on the art is 100' with no Foundry VTT subdivisions.

Heart of Sorrow</h3><blockquote>A mosaic floor adds a touch of color to the otherwise dark, cold, empty tower that rises above you. A spiral staircase rises slowly into darkness, hugging the outer wall. In the center of the room, another set of stairs leads down.</blockquote><br>Reveal <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=OWJhYjlhYTUzMDg2 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Handout: Area K20</a> when the characters enter this area.<br><br>The staircase in the center of the floor (area K20a) leads down to <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YWUwMjk4ZDM0NDI1 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K71</a>.<br><br>The spiral staircase has no railing and connects the main floor of the castle with each level above it. First, the staircase climbs 50 feet to a landing (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=Yjc3NTVkZDRiZmEz ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>shown on map 4</a>), from which an open archway leads to area K13. East of that opening is a secret door that conceals a ladder leading down to <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=Yjc3NTVkZDRiZmEz ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K34</a>.<br><br>The stairs ascend another 40 feet to another landing (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZTM3NDAwZGFhNGE5 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>shown on map 5</a>), with archways that lead to <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZTM3NDAwZGFhNGE5 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>areas K45 and K46</a>, and then climb another 100 feet to a landing beneath the tower’s heart (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=M2JjYzQ4NTk1NjM1 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>shown on map 8</a>). The staircase wraps around the heart, ending at the top of the tower (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=M2JjYzQ4NTk1NjM1 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K60</a>).<br><br><h4>The Heart</h4>The tower, including the spiral staircase, is alive. When the characters set foot on the staircase for the first time, read:<br><br><blockquote>As you step onto the spiral staircase, a reddish light flares high overhead, then settles into a dull, pulsing red glow. You now see the full immensity of this tower. The spiral staircase circles up the tower’s full height. The tower, sixty feet wide at its base, becomes narrower as it climbs. At the pinnacle of the hollow tower, a large crystal heart pulsates with red light. Above the heart, the stairs continue upward.</blockquote><br>Have the characters and the Heart of Sorrow roll initiative. If the characters leave the tower and later return, they can reroll initiative, but the heart’s initiative count doesn’t change.<br><br>The awakened tower shakes and pitches on the Heart of Sorrow’s initiative count. Any creature on the stairs or hanging on a tower wall at the start of the heart’s turn must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall to the base of the tower. Characters who are crawling on the staircase or who lie prone on the stairs succeed automatically.<br><br>The Heart of Sorrow is a 10-foot-diameter red crystal heart that floats near the top of the tower. Characters standing on the nearby stairs can make melee attacks against the heart, provided their weapons have a reach of at least 10 feet. The glass heart has AC 15 and 50 hit points. If the heart is reduced to 0 hit points, it shatters, and its crystal shards transform into blood, which rains down on the tower interior and staircase. The destruction of the Heart of Sorrow causes the tower to stop shuddering, and the interior of the tower becomes dark. Destroying the heart earns the characters 1,500 XP.<br><br><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTZiYzA5N2ViNTZi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Strahd</a> and the Heart of Sorrow are connected, such that any damage Strahd takes is transferred to the heart. If the heart absorbs damage that drops it to 0 hit points, it is destroyed, and Strahd takes any leftover damage. The Heart of Sorrow regains all its hit points at dawn if it has at least 1 hit point remaining.<br><br>The Heart of Sorrow is held aloft by the will of Strahd. Casting <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=MGIwMTBiN2M3ODM2 ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>dispel magic</a></em> on it has no effect.<br><br><strong><em>Animated Halberds.</em></strong> Mounted on the walls along the section of staircase nearest the heart are ten <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MWMyMjJlYTQ4ZGM5 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>animated halberds</a></strong>. The halberds attack any creature that threatens the Heart of Sorrow.<br><br><strong><em>Vampire Spawn.</em></strong> Strahd senses if any damage is done to the Heart of Sorrow and sends four <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YWM4NmJjYmJiMGE1 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>vampire spawn</a></strong> to destroy those responsible. These vampire spawn are former adventurers whom Strahd defeated long ago. They use their Spider Climb feature to scuttle along the tower walls and arrive in 3 rounds.<br><hr><br><h3>K47. Portrait of Strahd</h3><blockquote>You come to a dark landing ten feet wide and twenty feet long. A cold draft of wind rushes down the spiral staircase at the north end of the east wall and whistles mournfully through the room before streaming down the stairs to the south.<br><br>An ornate, square rug covers the floor to the south. Set into the west wall is an ironbound wooden door with a wooden trapdoor set into the floor in front of it. Hanging on the north wall above the trapdoor is a framed portrait of a handsome, well-dressed man with a serene yet penetrating gaze.</blockquote><br>The ornate rug is actually a <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YzE3ZTkwODU2YzVi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>rug of smothering</a></strong>. It attacks creatures, other than undead, that move across it or anyone who tries to move it or otherwise disturb it. Underneath the rug is a bare stone floor.<br><br>The wooden, square trapdoor is 4 feet on a side and as thick as the floor, with recessed iron hinges and an iron ring built into the side opposite the hinges. Pulling up on the ring opens the door. Below the trapdoor, characters see one of two things: either a 170-foot-deep shaft (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=Yjc3NTVkZDRiZmEz ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K31a</a>) or, if the elevator trap has been activated (see <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YWUwMjk4ZDM0NDI1 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K61</a>), a stone elevator compartment with a secret hatch in its top.<br><br>The portrait (see <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YWU5NmFlNTIxYzg0 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Handout: Portrait of Strahd</a>) on the wall depicts <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTZiYzA5N2ViNTZi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i></a>Strahd von Zarovich before he became a vampire. Even in life, he was pale. The eyes of the portrait seem to watch and follow the characters as they explore the area. The picture frame is bolted to the wall and can’t be removed without destroying it.<br><br>If the characters attack the rug or the picture, or if they attempt to remove either item, the <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YmJhMjg2ZTA2MGFk ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>guardian portrait</a></strong> attacks.<br><br><hr><br><h3>K48. Offstair</h3><blockquote>This spiraling staircase is dark and dusty.</blockquote><br>This stairway rises from <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=M2JjYzQ4NTk1NjM1 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K47</a>, past <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=M2JjYzQ4NTk1NjM1 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K54</a>, to <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=M2JjYzQ4NTk1NjM1 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K57</a>.<br><br><hr><br><h3>K49. Lounge</h3><blockquote>As thunder shakes the tower, heavy beams groan under the weight of the ceiling. Three ornate lanterns hang by chains from these beams, each casting a dim glow. The curved west wall is fitted with three windows of leaded glass in steel latticework. A bookcase sits on the east wall between two doors. Plush, overstuffed chairs and couches are placed about the room. The fabric has faded with age, and the patterns it depicts are nearly gone. Lounging on one couch is a handsome young man whose attire, while elegant, is worn and faded.</blockquote><br>The youthful man on the couch is <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZmYxNWNkOWY3Y2Fj ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Escher</a></strong>, a dashing vampire spawn to whom Strahd has shown favor in the past. Escher is feeling somewhat neglected of late and has retreated here until Strahd’s mood improves. If attacked, he hurls himself out the window and lands like a cat on the roof of the keep (area K53). He leads pursuers right to Strahd, wherever the lord of the castle happens to be (and regardless of whether the characters are ready to face Strahd).<br><br>In conversation, Escher displays wit with a hint of melancholy. Beneath his arch mood is a dread that Strahd is growing bored of him and will lock him in the catacombs (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YzI0YTFjYTVjY2Jh ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K84</a>) with Strahd’s other castoff consorts.<br><br>The leaded windows are fitted with iron hinges and can be opened. They can be locked from the inside, though they are currently unlocked. The leaded glass doesn’t allow for much of a view. If a character opens a window and leaves it open, there’s a 50 percent chance that a <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YWM4NmJjYmJiMGE1 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>vampire spawn</a></strong> crawling around the outside wall of the tower notices the open window and investigates.<br><br>The books in the bookcase have no value and aren’t much help to the characters. Some of the titles found on the bookshelf include <em>Embalming: The Lost Art</em>, Life Among the Undead: Learning to Cope, <em>Castle Building 101</em>, and <em>Goats of the Balinok Mountains</em>.<br><br><h4>Treasure</h4>On the third finger of his left hand, Escher wears a platinum ring engraved with tiny roses and thorns (worth 150 gp). Around his neck, he wears a gold and ruby pendant (worth 750 gp).<br><br><hr><br><h3>K50. Guest Room</h3><blockquote>A large bed sits in the center of this room, its four corner posts supporting a black canopy trimmed with gold tassels. Several comfortable divans are placed about the room. There is a banded door in the west wall and a smaller unbanded door in the east wall.</blockquote><br>There is no danger in this area during the day. But if the characters try to take a short rest here during the night, the rest is interrupted by the arrival of 1d4 <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=M2IwM2NkNzM2YWFm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i><strong>Barovian witches</strong></a> from area K56. They try to subdue the party with <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=MzYxMTNlOWJjMTQ0 ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>sleep</a></em> spells. A witch retreats to <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=M2JjYzQ4NTk1NjM1 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K56</a> if wounded.<br><br><hr><br><h3>K51. Closet</h3><blockquote>This small, wood-paneled room reeks of mildew and has a ten-foot-high ceiling. Iron hooks line the walls, and a dusty black cloak hangs from one hook in the center of the south wall.</blockquote><br>The cloak is ordinary. The witches in <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=M2JjYzQ4NTk1NjM1 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K56</a> placed it here to help them remember which hook opens the secret trapdoor in the ceiling.<br><br>The trapdoor can be found after a search of the room and a successful DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check. Locating the trapdoor doesn’t enable someone to discover its opening mechanism. The door has a hidden lock and can be opened by pulling down on the hook from which the black cloak hangs. Once it has been found, the trapdoor can be opened by pulling on the hook, or it can be unlocked by someone using thieves’ tools, a <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=NzgzNWMwNDZlYzNh ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>knock</a></em> spell, or similar magic. It swings down when unlocked.<br><br><hr><br><h3>K52. Smokestack</h3><blockquote>Jutting from the steeply sloping rooftop of the castle, a spindly smokestack, five feet in diameter at the top, rises thirty feet above the roof’s peak. Smoke belches from its iron-pronged capstone.</blockquote><br>The chimney leads down 60 feet to the blazing fireplace in <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZTM3NDAwZGFhNGE5 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K37</a>. A creature that starts its turn in the chimney takes 3 (1d6) fire damage.<br><br><hr><br><h3>K53. Rooftop</h3><blockquote>Rain splashes against the sagging, sloping rooftop. Flashes of lightning illuminate gargoyles perched on the roof’s end peaks, their hideous stares forever fixed on the courtyard some one hundred thirty feet below.</blockquote><br>If a character tries to traverse the rooftop, read:<br><br><blockquote>Some of the ancient roof tiles slide easily underfoot, easily dropping into the fog-shrouded darkness. Each falling tile resounds with a hollow click as it hits the flagstones of the parapet or courtyard below.</blockquote><br>A character must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to traverse the roof. The check succeeds automatically if the character crawls. If the check fails by 5 or more, the character slides off the edge of the roof and falls 40 feet to the castle parapet (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZTM3NDAwZGFhNGE5 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K46</a>).<br><br><hr><strong>Note: </strong>The following text refers to Map 7-10.<br><hr><br><h3>K54. Familiar Room</h3><blockquote>The low ceiling of this twenty-foot-square room presses down on you. Torn and broken couches lie in heaps, haphazardly strewn about. Deep claw marks cover the hardwood furniture, and the once lush upholstery has been sliced to shreds. From the dark shadows amid the rubble, three pairs of green eyes stare back at you.</blockquote><br>The three <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MDQ2ZTQ4MDkyNTMy ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>cats</a></strong> are familiars of the witches in area K56. If the familiars see the characters here, the witches are alerted to their presence.<br><br><hr><br><h3>K55. Element Room</h3><blockquote>Heavy beams support the ceiling of this large room, the outer wall of which curves to follow the shape of the tower. Dim light filters into the room through the steel lattice squares of two leaded glass windows. Several tables stand throughout the room, weighed down by stacks of glass jars and bottles, all of them bearing labels.</blockquote><br>The labeled glass containers hold various elements that the witches use in their fell concoctions and rituals. The labels identify such items as “Eye of Newt,” “Hair of Bat,” “Snail Hearts,” and “Frog’s Breath.” There are no magic potions among the bottles and jars.<br><br>The leaded windows are fitted with iron hinges and can be opened. They are currently locked from the inside. If a character opens a window and leaves it open, there’s a 50 percent chance that a <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YWM4NmJjYmJiMGE1 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>vampire spawn</a></strong> crawling around the outside wall of the tower notices the open window and investigates.<br><br>Characters who search the room spot numerous boot prints in the dust, as well as a short trail in the dust on the floor, leading from the northeast corner of the room to the easternmost door. It looks like something heavy was dragged across the floor toward the doorway.<br><br>There is a secret trapdoor in the northeast corner of the floor. Because of the trail through the dust, the trapdoor can be found without an ability check. Tapping or knocking on the trapdoor three times releases a hidden latch, causing the trapdoor to swing down. Area K51 lies below. (There’s no ability check that will let the characters figure out the trick to opening the door. They can get that information from the witches, or perhaps by using a <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=OTlhMTU1MGRmY2E2 ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>divination</a></em> spell or similar magic.)<br><br><hr><br><h3>K56. Cauldron</h3>Characters who stand outside the door to this room can smell a pungent odor coming from within.<br><br>If the witches in this room have not been warned that the characters are coming, the characters can hear their horrid cackling. If the characters open the door slightly, they witness the scene described below:<br><br><blockquote>Green-glowing wisps of steam bubble up from a fat, black cauldron in the center of this dark, oppressive room. Surrounding the cauldron are several gaunt women in soiled black robes. These witches sit hunched on tall wooden stools, their tangled hair tucked under black, pointed hats. They take turns tossing ingredients into the cauldron, uttering fell incantations, and cackling maniacally.</blockquote><br>If the witches know the characters are coming, read the following text instead:<br><br><blockquote>Green-glowing wisps of steam bubble up from a fat, black cauldron in the center of this dark, oppressive room. Surrounding the cauldron are seven tall wooden stools.</blockquote> <br>The <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=M2IwM2NkNzM2YWFm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Barovian witches</a></strong> that dwell in this area have sworn themselves to Strahd’s service in exchange for arcane power. Seven witches are present when the characters arrive, minus any that might have been encountered and defeated in area K50. If the witches are expecting the characters, they cast <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=MmU0MTk4MmMxMTI3 ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>invisibility</a></em> spells and stand quietly in the corners of the room, hoping that the cauldron draws their prey inside. Although they prefer to attack at range with their spells, they can grow magic claws using <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=NDAzMDk4MDZhZjhk ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>alter self</a></em>.<br><br>When the cauldron is touched by someone who also speaks the proper command word (“Gorah!”), it magically heats any liquid placed inside it and remains hot for 3 hours, or until the command word is spoken again by someone within 5 feet of the cauldron. Once the cauldron’s property has been used, the cauldron can’t be activated again until the next dawn.<br><br>Captured witches will trade information in exchange for their lives and freedom, and can be forced to divulge the command word for activating and deactivating the cauldron. They also know how to open the trapdoor in area K55.<br><br><h4>Treasure</h4>Each witch carries a <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NDBhYzNmNWNmZDNl ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>potion of healing</a></em> that she made herself. There is a 30 percent chance that a potion has “gone bad,” in which case it’s actually a <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZDlkZDZlZjIyYWIx ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>potion of poison</a></em>.<br><br>Not visible from the entrance is a small table behind the cauldron on which sits an opened spellbook, seemingly on the verge of falling apart. The book is evil. Any non-evil creature that touches it or starts its turn with the book in its possession takes 5 (1d10) psychic damage.

Tower Roof</h3><blockquote>The sixty-foot-diameter tower roof is rimmed with battlements. A slender stone bridge with no railing spans the gap between this tower and the slightly taller tower to the north. To the east, the high tower of Ravenloft thrusts skyward with no apparent opening at this level. Black, boiling clouds hurl rain down from above.</blockquote><br>The courtyard is 190 feet below, the roof of the keep 80 feet below. A stone railing encloses a stone spiral staircase that descends into the tower.<br><br><hr><br><h3>K58. Bridge</h3><blockquote>A strong wind blows across this slender bridge of stone and masonry. The bridge’s old iron railings have rusted away years ago, leaving the bridge without handholds.</blockquote><br>The bridge connects <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZmU0Yjk2NzNiY2U4 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>areas K20</a> and K57. The wind isn’t strong enough to knock creatures off the bridge, but a creature that takes damage while standing on the bridge must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall 60 feet onto the roof of the keep.<br><br><hr><br><h3>K59. High Tower Peak</h3>If the characters climb the stairs to reach the tower peak, read:<br><br><blockquote>The spiral staircase finally ends at a five-foot-wide stone walkway that circles the shaft. In the center of the tower’s highest floor, a fifteen-foot-diameter hole drops into the cold heart of Ravenloft itself. Cold air rushes up out of the shaft, sending a chill through you. Arrow slits line the walls, and aging beams support a steep, cone-shaped roof. One beam and part of the roof have fallen away, leaving a gaping hole open to the stormy sky.</blockquote><br>The hole in the floor forms the mouth of an enclosed shaft (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZmU0Yjk2NzNiY2U4 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K18a</a>) that descends 450 feet to the castle catacombs (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YzI0YTFjYTVjY2Jh ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K84</a>).<br><br><h4>Pidlwick II</h4>Hiding in the rafters is <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OGI5MzY5ZWEzMmQ4 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Pidlwick II</a></strong>. A character spots Pidlwick II with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score that meets or exceeds its Dexterity (Stealth) check. If Pidlwick II is spotted, read:<br><br><blockquote>Something lurks among the rafters—a small, spindly man not much larger than a child. A flash of lightning illuminates his face, which is painted like a grinning jack-o’-lantern.</blockquote><br>Although he appears to be a petite man wearing face paint and a fool’s costume, Pidlwick II is actually a clockwork effigy of the real-life Pidlwick, who lies entombed in the catacombs. The dark paint on his face is soot.<br><br>If the characters see Pidlwick II in bright light, read:<br><br><blockquote>It’s obvious that you’re looking not at a small man, but a mockery of one. This thing is not a creature of flesh and bone, but a construct made of dyed leather stitched and tightly wrapped over an articulated frame. You hear the soft tumbling and clicking of gears.</blockquote><br><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OGI5MzY5ZWEzMmQ4 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Pidlwick II</a> can’t speak and doesn’t have an expressive face, so he relies mostly on hand gestures and simple diagrams to communicate. He understands Common but can’t read or write.<br><br>If the characters show kindness to the clockwork effigy, it accompanies them and tries its best to be helpful and entertaining. It knows its way around the castle and can serve as a silent guide.<br><br>If one or more characters are mean toward Pidlwick II, its quiet resentment of them grows, and at some point when the group is at the top of a staircase, it pushes one of the offending party members down the stairs. The target must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or tumble to the bottom of the staircase, taking 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10 feet fallen.<br><br><hr><br><h3>K60. North Tower Peak</h3>If the characters climb the stairs to this area, read:<br><br><blockquote>The stairs end at a dark and dreary room with manacles attached to the walls. In the middle of the room is a wood-framed bed fitted with leather restraints. At the foot of the bed rests a closed iron chest, is lid sculpted with an emblem.<br><br>A wooden ladder leads up to a trapdoor in the ceiling. Thin streams of water drip through the trapdoor’s rotting wood, forming a puddle around the base of the ladder. </blockquote><br>The ceiling here is 9 feet high. The manacles are rusted and can be easily torn from the walls. The trapdoor in the ceiling leads to the tower rooftop (area K60a).<br><br>The emblem worked into the lid of the iron chest is Strahd’s family crest.

North Tower Rooftop</h3><em>(Note: Area K60a is depicted on Ravenloft Map 2, where a top view of the castle can be enjoyed by players)</em><br><br><blockquote>A cold wind greets you atop the tower roof, its rain-slicked flagstones surrounded by a twenty-foot-diameter ring of stone battlements. The thunderclouds above suddenly coalesce into the terrible visage of Strahd. The face utters a ghastly moan as thousands of bats fly out of its gaping maw and descend upon the tower. </blockquote><br>Characters who remain on the roof are accosted by ten <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NjVhZTI3NTMzNjMz ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>swarms of bats</a></strong>, which arrive in 3 rounds.

The dark silhouette of <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NTZhOGQwMTVjZmM4 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Castle Ravenloft</a> looks down on this village from its perch atop a 1,000-foot-high column of rock known as the Pillarstone of Ravenloft.<br><br><h3>Mists of Ravenloft</h3>A deadly fog surrounds the land of Barovia and engulfs any creature that tries to leave. Even flying creatures are subject to the fog’s effects, which are as follows:<br><br><ul><li>A creature that starts its turn in the fog must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of exhaustion (see the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NWNiMzlkNGRmYTIx ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Exhaustion</a> handout). This exhaustion can’t be removed while the creature is in the fog.</li><li>No matter how far a creature travels in the fog, or in which direction it goes, it gets turned around so that it eventually finds itself back in Barovia.</li><li>The area within the fog is heavily obscured (see the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MzJiZDQ4ZDg0ZThk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Vision and Light</a> handout).</li></ul><br><h3>Sunlight in Barovia</h3>By the will of the Dark Powers, the sun never fully shines in the lands of Barovia. Even during the day, the sky is dimmed by fog or storm clouds, or the light is strangely muted. Barovian daylight is bright light, yet it isn’t considered sunlight for the purpose of effects and vulnerabilities, such as a vampire’s, tied to sunlight.<br><br>Nevertheless, Strahd and his vampire spawn tend to stay indoors most of the day and venture out at night, and they are subject to sunlight created by magic.<br></section>","img":""}

Ground Floor</h3><blockquote>The ground floor has been converted into a makeshift kitchen, but the room is filthy. Baskets and old dishware are piled everywhere. Adding to the clutter is a peddler’s cart, a chicken coop, a heavy wooden trunk, and a pretty wooden cabinet with flowers painted on its doors. In addition to the clucking of the chickens, you hear toads croaking.<br><br>\nThe sweet smell of pastries blends horridly with a stench that burns your nostrils. The awful odor comes out of an open, upright barrel in the center of the room.<br><br>\nWarmth issues from a brick oven against one wall, and a crumbling staircase ascends the wall across from it. Shrieks and cackles from somewhere higher up cause the old mill to shudder.<br></blockquote><br>The ceiling here is 8 feet high. If the characters explore the room, read:<br><br><blockquote>Small human bones litter the flagstone floor.</blockquote><br>Baking in the oven are a dozen dream pastries. Morgantha checks on them every 10 minutes. The staircase curls up to area O2.<br><br>\nThe barrel holds glistening, greenish-black demon ichor. Morgantha can use the barrel as a font for a <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=Mjk0MzU1YmQ4ZjE1 ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>scrying</a></em> spell. She can also knock on the barrel three times as an action to summon a <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OTJkMjcyZDg2ZmU0 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>dretch</a></strong>. The demon crawls out of the barrel at the end of Morgantha’s turn and obeys the night hag’s commands for 1 hour, after which it dissolves into a pool of ichor. Morgantha can summon up to nine dretches in this manner before the ichor is gone.<br><br>\nMorgantha’s cabinet contains wooden bowls full of herbs and baking ingredients, including flour, sugar, and several gourds of powdered bone. Hanging on the inside of the cabinet doors are a dozen locks of hair. Amid various concoctions are three small, labeled containers that hold elixirs. The first elixir, labeled “Youth,” is a golden syrup that magically makes the imbiber appear younger and more attractive for 24 hours. The second elixir, labeled “Laughter,” is a nonmagical red tea that infects the imbiber with <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZWJmMzYwZGFmMDIx ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>cackle fever</a>. The third elixir, a greenish milky liquid labeled “Mother’s Milk,” is actually a dose of <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YzI0YjQ0MTcyMGY3 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>pale tincture</a>.<br><br>\nThe chicken coop contains three chickens, a rooster, and a few laid eggs.<br><br>\nThe wooden trunk has tiny holes bored into its lid and contains a hundred croaking <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NzlmMWU0YmNiZTNj ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>toads</a></strong>. Several toads escape if the lid is lifted, but they are harmless.<br><br><hr><br><h3>O2. Bone Mill</h3>Unless she has been lured elsewhere, Morgantha is encountered here. This is where she grinds children’s bones to make the powder for her dream pastries.<br><br><blockquote>A haggard, heavyset old woman with a face as wrinkled as a boiled apple sweeps the floor, pushing around a few old bones and stirring up a cloud of white dust with her broom. She wears a bloodstained, flour-caked apron. A long, sharp bodkin impales her bundled-up mound of gray hair.<br><br>\nThe dirt-caked windows allow very little light to enter this eight-foot-high chamber, most of which is taken up by a large millstone connected to a wooden gear shaft that rises through the ceiling in the center of the room. A stone staircase continues up, toward the sound of loud cackling.</blockquote><br>The old woman is <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MDNhYzU3ZjlhMTBl ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i><strong>Morgantha</strong></a>. She doesn’t mind visitors, as long as they’ve come to do business. She tries to sell her latest batch of dream pastries, charging 1 gp for each one. She’s proud of her confections and claims that she uses only the finest ingredients. If the characters seem uninterested in her wares, she bellows, “Begone!” If they attack or refuse to leave, she calls out to her daughters and turns to fight.<br><br>The hags operate the millstone manually, since the arms of the windmill no longer function.<br><br><hr><br><h3>O3. Bedroom</h3>The <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZmM1NGJjZDBhMmU2 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>night hags</a></strong> Bella Sunbane and Offalia Wormwiggle are here, unless they have been drawn elsewhere.<br><br><blockquote>Dancing around a thick wooden gear shaft in the center of this cramped, circular room are two ugly young women wearing silk shawls and gowns of stitched flesh. Long needles stick out of their tangled mops of black hair. The women cackle with glee.<br><br>\nIn a rotting wooden closet are three crates, stacked one atop another, with small doors set into them. Next to the closet is a heap of discarded clothing. A ladder climbs to a wooden trapdoor in the nine-foot-high ceiling. A moldy bed with a tattered canopy stands nearby.</blockquote><br>Morgantha’s daughters are repulsive even in their human guises. When they are not singing, dancing, or telling terrible jokes to one another, they are pricking captured children with needles to make them cry. Any attempt to free the children incurs the hags’ wrath.<br><br>\nThe discarded clothing belongs to children whom the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZmM1NGJjZDBhMmU2 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>night hags</a> have already devoured. The trapdoor in the ceiling can be pushed open to reveal area O4.<br><br>\nEach crate is 3 feet square. The top one is empty, but the middle and lower ones each contain a captive child. <br><br>The outward-facing side of each crate is fitted with a small door that has an iron latch and iron hinges. It can be unlatched and opened easily from the outside.<br><br>\nThe two captured children (LG male and female noncombatants) were taken from the village of Barovia after being given to the hags by their parents in exchange for dream pastries. The boy, Freek, is seven years old. The girl, Myrtle, is barely five. Their crates are full of crumbs, as the hags are fattening them up. If freed, neither child wants to go home, because of what their parents did. They both speak kindly of Ismark and Ireena in Barovia, hoping to be taken to them.<br><br><h4>Treasure</h4>The hags don’t use the bed for sleeping, but they store their treasure in it. Six pieces of cheap jewelry (worth 25 gp each) are stuffed in the moldy straw mattress.<br><br><hr><br><h3>O4. Domed Attic</h3><blockquote>You’ve reached the windmill’s peak—a domed chamber filled with old machinery. There’s not much room to move around. Light slips into this attic through small holes in the walls.</blockquote><br>Characters searching this space find a few old, abandoned bird’s nests.<br><br><h4><span style=\"color: rgb( 99 , 36 , 35 )\">Fortunes of Ravenloft</span></h4><span style=\"color: rgb( 99 , 36 , 35 )\"></span>If your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it’s easy to find, either tucked in a bird’s nest or buried under some dirt in a corner.<br><br></section>","img":"modules/cor-cos/journal/006_-_Chapter_6_3A_Old_Bonegrinder/004_-_Areas_of_the_Windmill/avatar.webp"}

Entrance</h3>A wrought-iron gate with hinges on one side and a lock on the other fills the archway of a stone portico (area 1A). The gate is unlocked, and its rusty hinges shriek when the gate is opened. Oil lamps hang from the portico ceiling by chains, flanking a set of oaken doors that open into a grand foyer (area 1B).<br><br>Hanging on the south wall of the foyer is a shield emblazoned with a coat-of-arms (a stylized golden windmill on a red field), flanked by framed portraits of stony-faced aristocrats (long-dead members of the Durst family). Mahogany-framed double doors leading from the foyer to the main hall (area 2A) are set with panes of stained glass.<br><hr><br><h3>2. Main Hall</h3>A wide hall (area 2A) runs the width of the house, with a black marble fireplace at one end and a sweeping, red marble staircase at the other. Mounted on the wall above the fireplace is a longsword (nonmagical) with a windmill cameo worked into the hilt. The wood-paneled walls are ornately sculpted with images of vines, flowers, nymphs, and satyrs. Characters who search the walls for secret doors or otherwise inspect the paneling can, with a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check, see serpents and skulls inconspicuously woven into the wall designs. The decorative paneling follows the staircase as it circles upward to the second floor.<br><br>A cloakroom (area 2B) has several black cloaks hanging from hooks on the walls. A top hat sits on a high shelf.<br><hr><br><h3>3. Den of Wolves</h3>This oak-paneled room looks like a hunter’s den. Mounted above the fireplace is a stag’s head, and positioned around the outskirts of the room are three stuffed wolves.<br><br>Two padded chairs draped in animal furs face the hearth, with an oak table between them supporting a cask of wine, two carved wooden goblets, a pipe rack, and a candelabrum. A chandelier hangs above a cloth-covered table surrounded by four chairs.<br><br>Two cabinets stand against the walls. The east cabinet sports a lock that can be picked with thieves’ tools and a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. It holds a heavy crossbow, a light crossbow, a hand crossbow, and 20 bolts for each weapon. The north cabinet is unlocked and holds a small box containing a deck of playing cards and an assortment of wine glasses.<br><br><h4>Trapdoor</h4>A trapdoor is hidden in the southwest corner of the floor. It can’t be detected or opened until the characters approach it from the underside (see area 32). Until then, Death House supernaturally hides the trapdoor.<br><hr><br><h3>4. Kitchen and Pantry</h3>The kitchen (area 4A) is tidy, with dishware, cookware, and utensils neatly placed on shelves. A worktable has a cutting board and rolling pin atop it. A stone, dome-shaped oven stands near the east wall, its bent iron stovepipe connecting to a hole in the ceiling. Behind the stove and to the left is a thin door leading to a well-stocked pantry (area 4B). All the food in the pantry appears fresh but tastes bland.<br><br><h4>Dumbwaiter</h4>Behind a small door in the southwest corner of the kitchen is a dumbwaiter—a 2-foot-wide stone shaft containing a wooden elevator box attached to a simple rope-and-pulley mechanism that must be operated manually. The shaft connects to areas 7A (the servants’ quarters) and 12A (the master bedroom). Hanging on the wall next to the dumbwaiter is a tiny brass bell attached by wires to buttons in those other areas.<br><br>A Small character can squeeze into the elevator box with a successful DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. The dumbwaiter’s rope-and-pulley mechanism can support 200 pounds of weight before breaking.<br><hr><br><h3>5. Dining Room</h3>The centerpiece of this wood-paneled dining room is a carved mahogany table surrounded by eight high-backed chairs with sculpted armrests and cushioned seats. A crystal chandelier hangs above the table, which is covered with resplendent silverware and crystalware polished to a dazzling shine. Mounted above the marble fireplace is a mahogany-framed painting of an alpine vale.<br><br>The wall paneling is carved with elegant images of deer among the trees. Characters who search the walls for secret doors or otherwise inspect the paneling can, with a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check, see twisted faces carved into the tree trunks and wolves lurking amid the carved foliage.<br><br>Red silk drapes cover the windows, and a tapestry depicting hunting dogs and horse-mounted aristocrats chasing after a wolf hangs from an iron rod bolted to the south wall.<br><br>The silverware tarnishes, the crystal cracks, the portrait fades, and the tapestry rots if removed from the house.<br><hr><br><h3>6. Upper Hall</h3>Unlit oil lamps are mounted on the walls of this elegant hall. Hanging above the mantelpiece is a wood-framed portrait of the Durst family: Gustav and Elisabeth Durst with their two smiling children, Rose and Thorn. Cradled in the father’s arms is a swaddled baby, which the mother regards with a hint of scorn.<br><br>Standing suits of armor flank wooden doors in the east and west walls. Each suit of armor clutches a spear and has a visored helm shaped like a wolf’s head. The doors are carved with dancing youths, although close inspection and a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals that the youths aren’t really dancing but fighting off swarms of bats.<br><br>The red marble staircase that started on the first floor continues its upward spiral to area 11. A cold draft can be felt coming down the steps.<br><hr><br><h3>7. Servants’ Room</h3>An undecorated bedroom (area 7A) contains a pair of beds with straw-stuffed mattresses. At the foot of each bed is an empty footlocker. Tidy servants’ uniforms hang from hooks in the adjoining closet (area 7B).<br><br><h4>Dumbwaiter</h4>A dumbwaiter in the corner of the west wall has a button on the wall next to it. Pressing the button rings the tiny bell in area 4A.<br><hr><br><h3>8. Library</h3>The master of the house used to spend many hours here before his descent into madness.<br><br><blockquote>Red velvet drapes cover the windows of this room. An exquisite mahogany desk and a matching high-back chair face the entrance and the fireplace, above which hangs a framed picture of a windmill perched atop a rocky crag. Situated in corners of the room are two overstuffed chairs. Floor-to-ceiling bookshelves line the south wall. A rolling wooden ladder allows one to more easily reach the high shelves.</blockquote><br>The desk has several items resting atop it: an oil lamp, a jar of ink, a quill pen, a tinderbox, and a letter kit containing a red wax candle, four blank sheets of parchment, and a wooden seal bearing the Durst family’s insignia (a windmill). The desk drawer is empty except for an iron key, which unlocks the door to area 20.<br><br>The bookshelves hold hundreds of tomes covering a range of topics including history, warfare, and alchemy. There are also several shelves containing first-edition collected works of poetry and fiction. The books rot and fall apart if taken from the house.<br><br><h4>Secret Door</h4>A secret door behind one bookshelf can be unlocked and swung open by pulling on a switch disguised to look like a red-covered book with a blank spine. A character inspecting the bookshelf spots the fake book with a successful DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check. Unless the secret door is propped open, springs in the hinges cause it to close on its own. Beyond the secret door lies area 9.<br><hr><br><h3>9. Secret Room</h3>This secret room contains bookshelves packed with tomes describing fiend-summoning rituals and the necromantic rituals of a cult called the Priests of Osybus. The rituals are bogus, which any character can ascertain after studying the books for 1 hour and succeeding on a DC 12 Intelligence (Arcana) check.<br><br>A heavy wooden chest with clawed iron feet stands against the south wall, its lid half-closed. Sticking out of the chest is a skeleton in leather armor. Close inspection reveals that the skeleton belongs to a human who triggered a poisoned dart trap. Three darts are stuck in the dead adventurer’s armor and ribcage. The dart-firing mechanism inside the chest no longer functions.<br><br>Clutched in the skeleton’s left hand is a letter bearing the seal of <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTZiYzA5N2ViNTZi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i></a>Strahd von Zarovich (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MDQ1NWU5Mzk4ODQ4 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Handout: Strahd's Crest</a>), which the adventurer tried to remove from the chest. Written in flowing script, the letter reads as follows (show players <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MDRmYWRhYzc2MmZm ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Handout: Strahd's Letter</a>):<br><br><em>My most pathetic servant,<br><br>I am not a messiah sent to you by the Dark Powers of this land. I have not come to lead you on a path to immortality. However many souls you have bled on your hidden altar, however many visitors you have tortured in your dungeon, know that you are not the ones who brought me to this beautiful land. You are but worms writhing in my earth.<br><br>You say that you are cursed, your fortunes spent. You abandoned love for madness, took solace in the bosom of another woman, and sired a stillborn son. Cursed by darkness? Of that I have no doubt. Save you from your wretchedness? I think not. I much prefer you as you are.<br><br></em><div style=\"text-align: right\"><em>Your dread lord and master,<br></em><em>Strahd von Zarovich</em></div><h4>Treasure</h4>The chest contains three blank books with black leather covers (worth 25 gp each), three <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MTE4ZDc2ZGNkMWQ3 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>spell scrolls</a> (<em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=ODFlODk3OGE0ODNh ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>bless</a>, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=NjNjMzVhZGEzZDVi ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>protection from poison</a>,</em> and <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=OWY3Y2NhYjYxNDQy ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>spiritual weapon</a></em>), the deed to the house, the deed to a windmill, and a signed will. The windmill referred to in the second deed is situated in the mountains east of Vallaki (see chapter 6, “<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MDYyMDU5ZmM4Y2I1 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Old Bonegrinder</a>”). The will is signed by Gustav and Elisabeth Durst and bequeathes the house, the windmill, and all other family property to Rosavalda and Thornboldt Durst in the event of their parents’ deaths. The books, scrolls, deeds, and will age markedly if taken from the house but remain intact.<hr><br><h3>10. Conservatory</h3>Gossamer drapes cover the windows of this elegantly appointed hall, which has a brass-plated chandelier hanging from the ceiling. Upholstered chairs line the walls, and stained-glass wall hangings depict beautiful men, women, and children singing and playing instruments.<br><br>A harpsichord with a bench rests in the northwest corner. Near the fireplace is a large standing harp. Alabaster figurines of well-dressed dancers adorn the mantelpiece. Close inspection of them reveals that several are carvings of well-dressed skeletons.<br><hr><br><h3>11. Balcony</h3>Characters who climb the red marble staircase to its full height come to a dusty balcony with a suit of black plate armor standing against one wall, draped in cobwebs. This suit of <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MGNmMDcyMjFhMTVh ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>animated armor</a></strong> attacks as soon as it takes damage or a character approaches within 5 feet of it. It fights until destroyed.<br><br>Oil lamps are mounted on the oak-paneled walls, which are carved with woodland scenes of trees, falling leaves, and tiny critters. Characters who search the walls for secret doors or otherwise inspect the paneling can, with a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check, notice tiny corpses hanging from the trees and worms bursting up from the ground.<br><br><h4>Secret Door</h4>A secret door in the west wall can be found with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. It pushes open easily to reveal a cobweb-filled wooden staircase leading up to the attic.<br><hr><br><h3>12. Master Suite</h3>The double doors to this room have dusty panes of stained glass set into them. Designs in the glass resemble windmills.<br><br>The dusty, cobweb-filled master bedroom (area 12A) has burgundy drapes covering the windows. Furnishings include a four-poster bed with embroidered curtains and tattered gossamer veils, a matching pair of empty wardrobes, a vanity with a wood-framed mirror and jewelry box (see “Treasure”), and a padded chair. A rotting tiger-skin rug lies on the floor in front of the fireplace, which has a dust-covered portrait of Gustav and Elisabeth Durst hanging above it. A web-filled parlor in the southwest corner contains a table and two chairs. Resting on the dusty tablecloth is an empty porcelain bowl and a matching jug.<br><br>A door facing the foot of the bed has a full-length mirror mounted on it. The door opens to reveal an empty, dust-choked closet (area 12B). A door in the parlor leads to an outside balcony (area 12C).<br><br><h4>Dumbwaiter</h4>A dumbwaiter in the corner of the west wall has a button on the wall next to it. Pressing the button rings the tiny bell in area 4A.<br><br><h4>Treasure</h4>The jewelry box on the vanity is made of silver with gold filigree (worth 75 gp). It contains three gold rings (worth 25 gp each) and a thin platinum necklace with a topaz pendant (worth 750 gp).<br><hr><br><h3>13. Bathroom</h3>This dark room contains a wooden tub with clawed feet, a small iron stove with a kettle resting atop it, and a barrel under a spigot in the east wall. A cistern on the roof used to collect rainwater, which was borne down a pipe to the spigot; however, the plumbing no longer works.<br><hr><br><h3>14. Storage Room</h3>Dusty shelves line the walls of this room. A few of the shelves have folded sheets, blankets, and old bars of soap on them. A cobweb-covered <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MDJlNWQ2ZjZiNWJi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>broom of animated attack</a></strong> leans against the far wall; it attacks any creature approaching within 5 feet of it.<br><hr><br><h3>15. Nursemaid’s Suite</h3>Dust and cobwebs shroud an elegantly appointed bedroom (area 15A) and an adjoining nursery (area 15B). Double doors set with panes of stained glass pull open to reveal a balcony (area 15C) overlooking the front of the house.<br><br>The bedroom once belonged to the family’s nursemaid. The master of the house and the nursemaid had an affair, which led to the birth of a stillborn baby named Walter. The cult slew the nursemaid shortly thereafter. Unless the characters already defeated it in area 18, the nursemaid’s spirit haunts the bedroom as a <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OTJmMjVhNzNlOWY0 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>specter</a></strong>. The specter manifests and attacks when a character opens the door to the nursery. The specter resembles a terrified, skeletally thin young woman; it can’t speak or be reasoned with.<br><br>The bedroom contains a large bed, two end tables, and an empty wardrobe. Mounted on the wall next to the wardrobe is a full-length mirror with an ornate wooden frame carved to look like ivy and berries. Characters who search the wall for secret doors or otherwise inspect the mirror can, with a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check, notice eyeballs among the berries. The wall behind the mirror has a secret door in it (see “Secret Door” below).<br><br>The nursery contains a crib covered with a hanging black shroud. When characters part the shroud, they see a tightly wrapped, baby-sized bundle lying in the crib. Characters who unwrap the blanket find nothing inside it.<br><br><h4>Secret Door</h4>A secret door behind the mirror can be found with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. It pushes open easily to reveal a cobweb-filled wooden staircase leading up to the attic.<br><hr><br><h3>16. Attic Hall</h3>This bare hall is choked with dust and cobwebs.<br><br><h4>Locked Door</h4>The door to area 20 is held shut with a padlock. Its key is kept in the library (area 8), but the lock can also be picked with thieves’ tools and a successful DC 15 Dexterity check.<br><hr><br><h3>17. Spare Bedroom</h3>This dust-choked room contains a slender bed, a nightstand, a small iron stove, a writing desk with a stool, an empty wardrobe, and a rocking chair. A smiling doll in a lacy yellow dress sits in the northern window box, cobwebs draping it like a wedding veil.<br><hr><br><h3>18. Storage Room</h3>This dusty chamber is packed with old furniture (chairs, coat racks, standing mirrors, dress mannequins, and the like), all draped in dusty white sheets. Near an iron stove, underneath one of the sheets, is an unlocked wooden trunk containing the skeletal remains of the family’s nursemaid, wrapped in a tattered bedsheet stained with dry blood. A character inspecting the remains and succeeding on a DC 14 Wisdom (Medicine) check can verify that the woman was stabbed to death by multiple knife wounds.<br><br>If the characters disturb the remains, the nursemaid’s <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OTJmMjVhNzNlOWY0 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>specter</a></strong> appears and attacks unless it was previously defeated in area 15.<br><br><h4>Secret Door</h4>A secret door in the east wall appears only when certain conditions are met; see area 21 for more information.<br><hr><br><h3>19. Spare Bedroom</h3>This web-filled room contains a slender bed, a nightstand, a rocking chair, an empty wardrobe, and a small iron stove.<br><hr><br><h3>20. Children’s Room</h3>The door to this room is locked from the outside (see area 16 for details).<br><br><blockquote>This room contains a bricked-up window flanked by two dusty, wood-framed beds sized for children. Closer to the door is a toy chest with windmills painted on its sides and a dollhouse that’s a perfect replica of the dreary edifice in which you stand. These furnishings are draped in cobwebs. Lying in the middle of the floor are two small skeletons wearing tattered but familiar clothing. The smaller of the two cradles a stuffed doll that you also recognize.</blockquote><br>The Durst children, Rose and Thorn, were neglected by their parents and locked in this room until they starved to death. Their small skeletons lie in the middle of the floor, plain as day, wearing tattered clothing that the characters recognize as belonging to the children. Thorn’s skeleton cradles the boy’s stuffed doll.<br><br>The toy chest contains an assortment of stuffed animals and toys. Characters who search the dollhouse and succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check find all of the house’s secret doors, including one in the attic that leads to a spiral staircase (a miniature replica of area 21).<br><br><h4>Rose and Thorn</h4>If either the dollhouse or the chest is disturbed, the ghosts of <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NTY3NWVkYTdiZjUz ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i><strong>Rose</strong></a> and <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MmM2YjA2OTRlYmRi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i><strong>Thorn</strong></a> appear in the middle of the room. <br><br>The children don’t like it when the characters disturb their toys, but they fight only in self-defense. Unlike the illusions outside the house, these children know that they’re dead. If asked how they died, Rose and Thorn explain that their parents locked them in the attic to protect them from “the monster in the basement,” and that they died from hunger. If asked how one gets to the basement, Rose points to the dollhouse and says, “There’s a secret door in the attic.” Characters who then search the dollhouse for secret doors gain advantage on their Wisdom (Perception) checks to find them.<br><br>The children fear abandonment. If one or more characters try to leave, the ghost-children attempt to possess them. If one of the ghosts possesses a character, allow the player to retain control of the character, but assign the character one of the following flaws:<br><br><ul><li>A character possessed by <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NTY3NWVkYTdiZjUz ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Rose</a> gains the following flaw: “I like being in charge and get angry when other people tell me what to do.”</li><li>A character possessed by <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MmM2YjA2OTRlYmRi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Thorn</a> gains the following flaw: “I’m scared of everything, including my own shadow, and weep with despair when things don’t go my way.”</li></ul><br>A character possessed by the ghost of Rose or Thorn won’t willingly leave Death House or the dungeon below it. Both ghosts can be intimidated into leaving their hosts with a successful DC 11 Charisma (Intimidation) check made as an action.<br><br>A ghost reduced to 0 hit points can reform at dawn the next day. The only way to put the children’s spirits to rest is to put their skeletal remains in their tombs (areas 23E and 23F). The children don’t know this, however.<br><br><h4>Development</h4>If the party lays the children’s spirits to rest, each character gains inspiration (see “<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NzEzNDRiYzRjMGM5 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Inspiration</a>” handout).<br><hr><br><h3>21. Secret Stairs</h3>A narrow spiral staircase made of creaky wood is contained within a 5-foot-wide shaft of mortared stone that starts in the attic and descends 50 feet to the dungeon level, passing through the lower levels of the house as it makes its descent. Thick cobwebs fill the shaft and reduce visibility in the staircase to 5 feet.<br><br><ul><li>The secret door and shaft don’t exist until the house reveals them, which can happen in one of two ways:</li><li>The characters find Strahd’s letter in the secret room behind the library (area 9).</li><li>The characters find the replica secret door in the attic of the dollhouse (area 20).</li></ul>Once the house wills the secret door into existence, characters find it automatically if they search the wall (no ability check required). Characters who descend the spiral staircase end up in <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=OTgyMjI0M2NmZjZm ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area 22</a>.<br></section>","img":"modules/cor-cos/journal/018_-_Appendix_B_3A_Death_House/002_-_Death_House/avatar.webp"}

It is but another span of time between the challenges of true adventuring.<br><br>Outside the tavern, a fog lies over the town this evening. The damp, cobbled pavement glistens as the lights of street lanterns dance across the slick stones. The fog chills the bones and shivers the soul of anyone outside.<br><br>Yet inside these tavern walls the food is hearty, and the ale is warm and frothy. A fire blazes in the hearth, and the tavern is alive with the tumbling voices of country folk.<br><br>Suddenly, the tavern door swings open, and a hush falls over the room. Framed by the lamp-lit fog, a form strides through the doorway. His heavy, booted footfalls and the jingle of his coins shatter the silence. His brightly colored clothes are draped in loose folds about him, and his hat hangs askew, hiding his eyes in shadows. Without hesitation, he walks up to your table and stands proudly in a wide stance with folded arms.<br><br>In an accented voice he says, “I have been sent to you to deliver this message. If you be creatures of honor, you will come to my master’s aid at first light. It is not advisable to travel the Svalich Woods at night!” He pulls from his tunic a sealed letter, addressed to all of you in beautiful flowing script. He drops the letter on the table. “Take the west road from here some five hours march down through the Svalich Woods. There you will find my master in Barovia.”<br><br>Amid the silent stares of the patronage, the gypsy strides to the bar and says to the wary barkeep, “Fill the glasses, one and all. Their throats are obviously parched.” He drops a purse heavy with gold on the bar. With that, he leaves.<br><br>The babble of tavern voices resumes, although somewhat subdued. The letter is lying before you. The seal is in the shape of a crest you don’t recognize.</blockquote><br>The characters can interrupt the messenger at any time. His name is<strong> <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OTExMDZkOWQ1MzRh ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Arrigal</a> </strong>(NE male human), and he is a <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NzAzZjc4MGFjNWZk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Vistani</a>. The other tavern patrons regard his people as friendly folk who travel about in covered wagons and usually keep to themselves.<br><br>Arrigal describes Barovia as a valley of great beauty and his master as a remarkable man. If the characters question Arrigal about the identity of his master, he claims to serve Burgomaster Kolyan Indirovich, but in truth he serves Strahd. After delivering the letter, Arrigal mounts his horse and rides off.

Gatehouse Portcullis</h3>When the characters approach from the west, read:<br><br><blockquote><p>The shelf of rock on which the mountain road clings grows narrow. To your left, the icy cliffs rise sharply toward dark, rolling clouds. To your right, the ground falls away into a sea of fog. Ahead, through the wind and snow, you see a high wall of black stone lined with spikes and topped by statues of demonic vultures with horned heads. Set in the center of the wall is a closed iron portcullis, behind which burns a curtain of green flame. <br><br>On the other side of the dark wall, gripping the mountain’s edge, is a guard tower of white stone topped by golden statues of mighty warriors.</p></blockquote><br>The gatehouse is 30 feet high. The adjoining walls are 20 feet high and line with stone spikes. If the characters circumvent the gate by flying or climbing over it, the statues on the gatehouse (area T2) animate and attack.<p></p><p><span id=\"userscript-docs-internal-guid-2de3254c-7fff-5b48-86b5-24a60bf1c285\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline\">If the characters approach within 10 feet of the portcullis, it shrieks with the sound of metal on metal as it rises on its own. It stays open for 1 minute, then closes.</span></span><br></p><hr><h3>T2. Demon Statues</h3>These statues are actually two petrified <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YmE1N2I1ZDY1OWJi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>vrocks</a></strong>. If they are attacked, or if the characters bypass the gatehouse, the vrocks revert to flesh and attack, pursuing prey that flees and fighting until slain.<br><hr><h3>T3. Curtain of Green Flame</h3>A curtain of green flame fills the eastern archway of the gatehouse. Any creature that enters the curtain for the first time on a turn or starts its turn in the green flame takes 33 (6d10) fire damage.<br><br>A successful casting of <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=MGIwMTBiN2M3ODM2 ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>dispel magic</a></em> (DC 16) suppresses the curtain for 1 minute. The curtain is also suppressed within an <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=Y2Y4MDhmZjhhMTgx ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>antimagic field</a></em>.<br><hr><h3>T4. Guard Tower, Ground Floor</h3>The tower door is made of ironbound wood and barred from within. A character can force open the door with a successful DC 22 Strength (Athletics) check.<br><br><blockquote>A cold hearth stands across from the door, the wind howling down its chimney. A stone staircase is on the south wall. Three windows look out over a foggy sea.</blockquote><br>The stairs climb 20 feet to area T5.<br><br><h4>Teleport Destination</h4>Characters who teleport to this location from <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YzI0YTFjYTVjY2Jh ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K78</a> in Castle Ravenloft arrive at the point marked X on the map.<br><hr><h3>T5. Guard Tower, Upper Floor</h3><blockquote>The upper level of the tower is an icebox with windows set in almost every wall. A rusted iron ladder bolted to the floor and ceiling leads up to a wooden trapdoor. Mounted above the stone hearth is a dire wolf’s head. The wind coming down the chimney howls in its stead.</blockquote><br>The trapdoor in the ceiling pushes open with a squeal, revealing the rooftop (area T6) and the stormy gray sky.<br><hr><h3>T6. Guard Tower Rooftop</h3><blockquote>Ten-foot-tall, gold-plated statues stand atop the battlements, facing outward. Each one depicts a female human knight holding a lance. The cold wind stirs the snow, under which you see human skeletons clad in rusty mail.</blockquote><br>The roof is 40 feet high and 540 feet above the misty valley below. A wooden trapdoor in the floor squeals as it is pulled open, revealing area T5 below.<br><br>The skeletons are the remains of four guards who held this post long ago. Characters who search the remains find tattered bits of cloth, broken longbows and arrows, rusted blades in ruined sheaths, and rusty chain mail.<br><br><h4><span style=\"color: rgb( 99 , 36 , 35 )\">Fortunes of Ravenloft</span></h4>If your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, read:<br><br><blockquote>The swirling snow assumes the forms of thin, young women. The wind howls, “Begone! The treasure is ours!”<br></blockquote>The forms are six <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTM4OTkyZGExOGJh ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>snow maidens</a></strong>. The snow maidens don’t speak, nor are they interested in hearing what the characters have to say. If the characters don’t leave at once, the snow maidens attack. When the last snow maiden is defeated, the treasure that the characters seek magically appears in the swirling snow on the rooftop.<br><hr><h3>T7. Western Arch</h3>When the characters approach the bridge, read:<br><br><blockquote>The snowy pass comes to a gorge spanned by a stone bridge. At each end of the bridge is a thirty-foot-tall, thirty-foot-wide stone arch. Atop each one are two statues of armored knights on horseback with lances, charging toward one another. The wind bites and howls like wolves as it passes through the gorge.</blockquote><br>The western arch contains empty guard posts, one on each side of the bridge. These 10-foot-wide chambers provide some protection against the howling wind.<br><hr><br><h3>T8. Stone Bridge</h3><blockquote>The low walls that enclose the stone bridge have fallen away in a couple of places, but the bridge appears intact. A black-cloaked rider on a charcoal-colored horse guards the middle of the bridge.</blockquote><br>The cloaked rider is a manifestation of Strahd von Zarovich—a grim warning to proceed no further. If the characters interact with the manifestation in any way, the rider and horse disperse like ash in the wind.<br><br>Five hundred feet below the bridge is the Luna River, barely visible through the fog. Though slippery in a few places, the 10-foot-wide, 90-foot-long bridge is safe to cross.<br><hr id=\"userscript-horizontalrule\"><br><h3>T9. Eastern Arch</h3><blockquote>One of the statues atop this arch has crumbled, leaving only the hindquarters of the horse intact. The mountain pass continues beyond.</blockquote><br>This arch contains 10-foot-square guard posts, one on each side of the bridge. Both rooms are empty.<br><br>Beyond this arch, Tsolenka Pass hugs the mountainside for three miles before branching north and south. The northern branch leads to the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NjAxOTQ4MWE0MmMy ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Amber Temple</a> (chapter 13).

This adventure hook offers an interaction with a group of <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NzAzZjc4MGFjNWZk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Vistani</a></strong>, one of the important groups in Barovia. <br><br><blockquote>Duchess Morwen of Daggerford is having guests for dinner—and you are invited. No strangers to Daggerford, you have come to the town’s defense on more than one occasion, and you count Lady Morwen as a friend and a benefactor.<br><br>A cool autumn breeze blows through the streets as you make your way to the keep. As you dine on hot, spicy soup and tenderly cooked pheasant, you can tell that the duchess seems more out of sorts than usual. Then a pall comes over the occasion as she voices her concern about a band of wayward travelers camped outside the town’s walls. They seemed harmless at first, but Morwen has received reports that they have begun harassing townsfolk and other visitors as they come and go, demanding money and wine, and threatening to put hexes on anyone who doesn’t pay up.<br><br>Yesterday, the duchess ordered several guards to scare away the mysterious visitors, but they couldn’t get the job done. When the guards returned, they spoke sympathetically about the visitors. It seemed as if the guards had been magically charmed.<br><br>Morwen doesn’t want an armed conflict, but she aims to send a stern message to the visitors and asks you to deliver it on her behalf. “If they don’t leave before dawn,” she says, “I’ll burn their wagons to the ground.”</blockquote><br>The characters are asked to deliver Duchess Morwen’s message immediately after dinner.<br><br>The travelers are camped on the hill outside the gates of Daggerford, near the road. Guards atop the walls watch the camp closely at all hours.<br><br>When the characters approach the camp, read:<br><br><blockquote>As the evening grows dark, you see a dozen men and women gathered around a crackling bonfire. The folk are in good spirits. A few of them sing and dance around the fire while others find happiness in their flasks and wineskins. Three barrel-topped wagons are parked at odd angles. Tied to a nearby tree, grazing, are half a dozen draft horses wearing bright coats with bangles and tassels.</blockquote><br>The men and women are <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NzAzZjc4MGFjNWZk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Vistani</a>. They have no interest in Daggerford.

If they deliver Duchess Morwen’s warning, read:<br><br><blockquote>Stanimir laughs. “Don’t worry. We have no wish to make enemies of Lady Morwen. I have a story to tell all of you. First you listen, then we go.”</blockquote><br>If the characters agree to hear Stanimir’s story, he invites them to gather around the fire and hear his tale:<br><br><blockquote>Stanimir fills his mouth with wine, then spits into the fire. The flames turn from orange to green. As they dance and sway, a dark shape appears in the bonfire’s core.<br><br>“We come from an ancient land whose name is long forgotten—a land of kings. Our enemies forced us from our homes, and now we wander the lost roads.”<br><br>The dark shape in the fire takes the form of a man being knocked from his horse, a spear piercing his side.<br><br>Stanimir continues. “One night, a wounded soldier staggered into our camp and collapsed. We nursed his terrible injury and quenched his thirst with wine. He survived. When we asked him who he was, he wouldn’t say. All he wanted was to return home, but we were deep in the land of his enemies. We took him as one of our own and followed him back toward his homeland. His enemies hunted him. They said he was a prince, yet we didn’t give him up, even when their assassins fell upon us like wolves.”<br><br>Deep in the bonfire, you see the dark figure standing with sword drawn, fighting off a host of shadowy shapes.<br><br>“This man of royal blood fought to protect us, as we protected him. We bore him safely to his home, and he thanked us. He said, ‘I owe you my life. Stay as long as you wish, leave when you choose, and know that you will always be safe here.’”<br><br>The figure in the dancing fire vanquishes its final foe, then disperses in a cloud of smoke and embers.<br><br>Stanimir’s face becomes a somber mask. “A curse has befallen our noble prince, turning him into a tyrant. We alone have the power to leave his domain. We’ve traveled far and wide to find heroes such as yourselves to end our dread lord’s curse and put his troubled soul to rest. Our leader, Madam Eva, knows all. Will you return to Barovia with us and speak with her?”</blockquote><br>During Stanimir's tale, reveal <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZGJjYjQ4NzAyOGQy ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Handout: Mysterious Visitors</a>.<br><br>These Vistani refuse to speak the name of their “dread lord” and provide no additional information. If the characters press them for details, the Vistani reply, “Madam Eva has the answers you seek.”<br><br>If the characters agree to accompany the Vistani, the Vistani lead them south along the Trade Way. After several days of uneventful travel, the mists of Ravenloft engulf the caravan, transporting the characters and the Vistani to Barovia. The Vistani then lead the party safely to their leader, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZGZiYWVmNjcxZGVm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Madam Eva</a>, at <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YWQ0Mjg0Mzk1ZTgw ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area G</a> (see chapter 2).

All the werewolves arrive in wolf form.<br><br>If the wolves can see evidence of an assault on the den (such as if the guards at <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YTVjNmQ2ZmVkZGY5 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area Z2</a> are absent or dead), the werewolves assume hybrid form. Kiril sends three werewolves up the mountainside to <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YTVjNmQ2ZmVkZGY5 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area Z8</a> to enter the den from above while he and the remainder of the hunting party make their way deeper into the den.<br><br><h3>Development</h3>As long as Kiril lives, the characters can’t negotiate with the werewolves. If Kiril dies and the characters have the upper hand, the pack is willing to negotiate with them.<br><br>If <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZjY1N2ZhZTg1OTUz ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Emil Toranescu</a> is present when Kiril returns, Emil is determined to kill his rival and become the new pack leader. If he succeeds, he allows the characters to leave the den unmolested but refuses to release the kidnapped children unless Zuleika is present to convince him otherwise (because she fears that the characters might kill her husband if he doesn’t let the children go).<br><br>If both Kiril and Emil die, Zuleika becomes pack leader and cuts all ties to Strahd. The ordinary wolves leave the pack once Strahd becomes aware of this development. If the characters were drawn into Barovia by the “<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZTAzMWQwNmYxYWQz ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Werewolves in the Mist</a>” adventure hook, the werewolf attacks on the Sword Coast come to an end under Zuleika’s leadership. If she is also dead, a young but fierce werewolf named Franz Groza becomes pack leader. He is vicious and treacherous, showing the characters no mercy.<br><hr><h3>Die Kinder</h3>If the characters get the children away from the den while Kiril is alive, Kiril reassembles his hunting party and pursues the lost prisoners relentlessly. If Kiril is dead, the werewolf pack is too preoccupied with determining Kiril’s successor to organize a hunting party.<br><br>If the characters aren’t sure where to take the children, a <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NzBhNmIwNTcxN2Y0 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>wereraven</a></strong> that has been spying on the den in raven form assumes hybrid form and suggests that they take refuge in the nearby village of <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=OWRkMTE5ZDk1Mjg2 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Krezk</a> (chapter 8). If the characters head that way, the wereraven scouts from overhead until the characters reach the village, whereupon it flies south to the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZTRkYjc1NzhiYjcz ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Wizard of Wines winery</a> (chapter 12) and reports what has happened to <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=Mzg3YWU3MzQ3MjRm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Davian Martikov</a>.<br><br>The children are understandably traumatized by their imprisonment in the werewolf den. They cry and scream the whole time they’re with the characters. A<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=YzY3NWI5NTFmMjRh ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i> </a><em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=YzY3NWI5NTFmMjRh ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>calm emotions</a></em> spell quells their anguish for the duration of the spell (no saving throws required). A character can try to silence the children for a longer period of time using intimidation, or by offering them hope (real or otherwise). The character must make a DC 15 Charisma (Intimidation, Persuasion, or Deception) check, as appropriate. If the check succeeds, the children remain silent until something happens to frighten them.<br><br>If the characters take the children to <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=OWRkMTE5ZDk1Mjg2 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Krezk</a>, the villagers there look after the children and see that they are fed and properly clothed. If the characters take them to Vallaki instead, the Martikovs allow the children to stay at the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=N2VhNzc0NDhlZmVi ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Blue Water Inn</a> until the characters return to collect them.<br></section>","img":""}

Coffin Maker's Shop</h2><blockquote>This uninviting shop is two stories tall and has a sign shaped like a coffin above the front door. All of the window shutters are closed up tight, and a deathly silence surrounds the establishment.</blockquote><strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MmZlMGUyNDcwYWE2 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i><br>Henrik van der Voort</a></strong> (LE male human) is a mediocre carpenter and a troubled, lonely man. He profits from the deaths of others, and no one desires his company, because of the ghastly nature of his handiwork. One night several months ago, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTZiYzA5N2ViNTZi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Strahd</a> visited Henrik in the guise of an imposing, well-dressed nobleman named Vasili von Holtz and promised the coffin maker “good business” in exchange for his help. Since then, Henrik’s workshop has become the lair of a pack of vampire spawn—former adventurers who were turned by Strahd. These vampires are lying low for the time being.<br><br>\nThe vampires plan to attack St. Andral’s church (see “St. Andral’s Feast” in <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=N2M0MmM5ZjE3Mzdj ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Special Events: Chapter 5</a>). When Henrik learned about the sacred bones buried under the church, the vampire spawn ordered him to steal the bones, which Henrik paid <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZjM3ZWRlYmJjZGRl ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Milivoj</a> the gravedigger (see <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YWIzMjIyNzE0OGFk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area N1</a>) to do.<br><br>\nEvery window of Henrik’s shop is a latticework of iron fitted with squares of frosted glass and locked from the inside. The outside doors of the shop are barred shut from within. If the characters knock on one of them, Henrik shouts, “We’re closed! Go away!” without opening the door. If the characters accuse Henrik of stealing the bones of St. Andral, he shouts again, “Go away! Leave me alone!”<br><br>\nIf the characters break into the store, Henrik offers no resistance. He tells them where to find the bones (in the upstairs bedroom wardrobe, area N6e) and the vampire nest (in the upstairs wood storage room, area N6f).<br><br>\nIf the characters report the theft of the bones to the burgomaster, Baron Vallakovich dispatches four <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NGVjOTU0NmM3ODMy ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>guards</a></strong> to arrest Henrik and retrieve the bones. If the guards show up during daylight hours, Henrik surrenders himself and the bones without a fight, claiming that vampires forced him to steal the bones. If the guards come at night, Henrik surrenders himself and tells the guards where the bones are hidden, but he won’t retrieve the bones himself for fear of being killed by the vampires.<br><br><hr><br><h3>N6a. Coffin Storage</h3><blockquote>Arranged haphazardly about the floor of this musty, L-shaped room are thirteen wooden coffins.</blockquote><br>Henrik stores and displays the coffins he has made in this room. All of them are empty.<br><br><hr><br><h3>N6b. Junk Room</h3><blockquote>A table with four chairs is in one corner of this room, with a lantern hanging form a chain directly above. Two well-made cabinets stand against the east wall.</blockquote><br>The cabinets are packed with worthless items that Henrik has collected over the years.<br><br><hr><br><h3>N6c. Workshop</h3><blockquote>This workshop contains everything a carpenter needs to make coffins and furniture. Three sturdy worktables stretch the length of the west wall.</blockquote><br>Henrik builds coffins and keeps his carpenter's tools in this room.<br><br><hr><br><h3>N6d. Kitchen</h3><blockquote>This kitchen contains a square table surrounded by chairs and shelves of provisions.</blockquote><br>Henrik prepares meals here.<br><br><hr><br><h3>N6e. Henrik's Bedroom</h3><blockquote>This modest bedchamber holds a cot and several well-made pieces of furniture, including a table, a padded chair, a bookshelf, and a wardrobe.</blockquote><br>Henrik sleeps here, at night and well into the morning. The bookshelf contains a handful of storybooks and carpenters’ manuals that have been handed down from previous generations.<br><br>\n<strong><em>Treasure. </em></strong>The wardrobe in the southeast corner has a secret compartment in its base, requiring a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to find. Inside the compartment are two sacks—a large one containing the bones of St. Andral and a small one containing 30 sp and 12 ep. All of the coins bear the profiled visage of Strahd von Zarovich.<br><br><hr><br><h3>N6f. Vampire Nest</h3><blockquote>This large, drafty room is strung with cobwebs and takes up most of the upper floor. Stacks of wooden planks lie amid several crates marked \"JUNK.\"<br></blockquote><br>The two southernmost crates contain old junk that Henrik has accumulated over the years. The six crates in the northern part of the room are packed with earth and serve as resting places for the six <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YWM4NmJjYmJiMGE1 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>vampire spawn</a></strong> that lair here. If the characters open one of the occupied crates, all of the vampire spawn burst forth and attack.<br><br>\n<strong><em>Teleport Destination. </em></strong>Characters who teleport to this location from <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YzI0YTFjYTVjY2Jh ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K78</a> in Castle Ravenloft arrive at the point marked T on the map.<br></section>","img":"modules/cor-cos/journal/005_-_Chapter_5_3A_The_Town_of_Vallaki/008_-_Coffin_Maker_27s_Shop/avatar.webp"}

The woods recede, revealing a sullen mountain burg surrounded by a wooden palisade. Thick fog presses up against this wall, as though looking for a way inside, hoping to catch the town aslumber.<br><br>\nThe dirt road ends at a set of sturdy iron gates with a pair of shadowy figures standing behind them. Planted in the ground and flanking the road outside the gates are a half-dozen pikes with wolves’ heads impaled on them.</blockquote><br>A 15-foot-high wall encloses the town, its vertical logs held together with thick ropes and mortar. The top of each log has been sharpened to a point. Wooden scaffolding hugs the inside of the palisade twelve feet off the ground, enabling guards to peer over the wall there.<br><br><h3>Town Gates</h3>Three tall gates made of iron bars lead into town:<br><br><ul><li>The north gate is sometimes called the Zarovich Gate, or “the gate to the lake,” because it leads to Lake Zarovich (chapter 2, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NDFhNjJjZDAyMGU3 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area L</a>).</li><li>The west gate is referred to as the Sunset Gate, even though no living person in Vallaki has seen an undimmed sunset. A few abandoned cottages line the road outside this gate.</li><li>The east gate is also known as the Morning Gate, or, as some locals like to call it, the Mourning Gate.</li></ul>Heavy iron chains with iron padlocks keep the gates shut at night. During the day, the gates are closed but not typically locked.<br><br>\nTwo town <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YjMyNmJkYjIxYjkx ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i><strong>gate guards</strong></a> (LG male and female humans) stand just inside each gate. They carry pikes. These weapons are long enough to stab creatures through the bars of the gate. The guards greet all visitors with suspicion, particularly those who arrive at night. If the characters arrive at night, one or more of them must succeed on a DC 20 Charisma (Persuasion) check to convince the guards to unlock the gate and let them enter.<br><br>\nIf trouble breaks out at one of the gates, the guards there cry out, “To arms!” Their shouts are echoed across Vallaki, putting the entire town on alert within minutes. Vallaki has twenty-four human <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NGVjOTU0NmM3ODMy ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>guards</a></strong>, half of whom are on duty at any given time (six stand watch at the gates, six patrol the walls).

When the ritual begins, the druids use their actions to chant and dance about. To complete the ritual, the druids must chant for 10 consecutive rounds, with at least one of them chanting each round. If a round goes by and none of the druids are able to chant on their turn, the ritual is ruined and must be started anew. If the Gulthias tree (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZWI2YTFiNTM4ZWFk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area Y4</a>) has been reduced to 0 hit points, the ritual won’t work.

The creature resembles a dead treant with green light seeping out of it.</blockquote>The creature that erupts from the wooden statue is a <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NmFiNzY5ODY1Y2I2 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>tree blight</a></strong> that the druids call Wintersplinter. The green light comes from the magic gem embedded in its “heart.” The gem can be removed only when Wintersplinter is dead.<br><br><p>\nThe druids command Wintersplinter to travel north and lay waste to the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZTRkYjc1NzhiYjcz ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Wizard of Wines</a> vineyard (chapter 12). Although the characters might not understand what the druids are up to, they will no doubt wonder where the druids are sending the tree blight. As Wintersplinter travels north, its destination should become clear to characters who have previously visited the winery and the vineyard. Whether they try to halt its advance is up to them.</p>\nOnce the tree blight departs, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTZiYzA5N2ViNTZi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Strahd</a> commands the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YTdmMjgwYzBiMTA2 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>druids</a> and <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OTAwYTNkNjI5MzZm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>berserkers</a> to leave the hill so that he can be alone.

Read the following text to that character’s player:<br><br><blockquote>You hear a whisper, a deep voice carried on the wind. “Long have I waited,” it says, “for one who is worthy. My spear hungers for blood. Retrieve it, and rule these mountains in my stead, just like the mighty warriors from the early days of the Whispering Wall.”</blockquote>The character feels drawn to one of the cairns on the hillside (see <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZWI2YTFiNTM4ZWFk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area Y2</a>). When the character approaches within 30 feet of it, the presence of Kavan’s magic spear (see “Treasure” below) under the rocks is felt.<br><br><h4>Treasure</h4>The rocks of the cairn are heavy but can be rolled aside, revealing a <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MmRkYmU0NGZhODVk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>blood spear</a></em> lying amid Kavan’s moldy bones.

We’re on the same side.”<br><br>Ezmerelda is hunting Strahd, but her efforts to corner the vampire have so far been thwarted, and she fears that she might be in over her head. If the characters don’t ask her to join the party, she wishes them well and goes on her way (perhaps to be encountered again later). If they invite her to accompany them, Ezmerelda tests the characters’ knowledge about vampires by asking them questions such as “Have you ever seen a vampire change its form?” and “Do you know how to counteract a vampire’s regenerative ability?” Whatever their answers, she ultimately agrees to come along.<br><br>This random encounter happens only once.

In that case, read:<br><br><blockquote>Creatures with pale flesh scuttle across the ceiling like spiders, their red eyes glowing in the dark. As they draw near, their cracked and bloodstained lips open wide, revealing sharp fangs.</blockquote><br>These minions of Strahd—former adventurers all—creep along ceilings and drop down on unsuspecting prey.

In truth, they are loyal to Strahd and betray the characters as soon as he appears. If the characters accept their offer, the thugs pretend to be the party’s allies for as long as they remain with the party, or until Strahd appears. If the characters leave the castle, the thugs accompany them, since choosing to remain in the castle would likely arouse the characters’ suspicion.<br><br><strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> One <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OTE2OGU4N2ViYjhm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Vistani thug</a> carries a pouch that holds 2d8 small gemstones (50 gp each).<br><br><hr><br><h3>Wights</h3><blockquote>The air grows much colder, and you can hear the march of footsteps drawing near.</blockquote><br>If the characters are moving quietly and not carrying light sources, they can try to hide from the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YzUzY2VhZmYxZDFh ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>wights</a>.

They marched to Castle Ravenloft and were confronted by the Vistani seer <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZGZiYWVmNjcxZGVm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Madam Eva</a>, who told them Strahd had died, only to become a prisoner in his own land, tormented by the death of his beloved Tatyana and the murder of his brother Sergei.<br><br>\nAfter receiving that news, Vladimir ceased his advance and led his knights back to Argynvostholt. He realized that Strahd had already died and been damned to a hell of his own creation. With nowhere else to go and nothing else to do, Vladimir set his knights to killing Strahd’s agents and anyone else who might help to ease Strahd’s torment. Consumed by hatred, the knights have lost their honor and nobility. Their redemption hinges on whether Vladimir can set aside that hatred. The undead knight can be found brooding in the ruins of Argynvostholt.<br><br><h3>Revenants of Barovia</h3>A <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ODIxNTQ5NTg2YmNk ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>revenant</a> has a year to achieve its revenge before its body crumbles to dust and its soul enters the afterlife. In Barovia, however, a revenant can remain in its body indefinitely, and once it has reaped its vengeance, its soul remains trapped in Barovia.<br><br>If the body of a revenant is destroyed before its vengeance is fulfilled, its spirit seeks out a new corpse or skeleton to animate. To determine where the revenant's new body rises, roll a d20 and consult the following table.<br><br><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>d20</strong></td><td><strong>Corpse Location</strong></td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align: center\">1-4</td><td>Village of Barovia cemetery (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YWZmNWU5OGQ4ZmJl ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>ch. 3, area E6</a>)</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align: center\">5-11</td><td>Church graveyard in Vallaki (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YWIzMjIyNzE0OGFk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>ch. 5, area N1</a>)</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align: center\">12</td><td>Argynvostholt cemetery (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=OGZkMWVkZjExOTc5 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area Q15</a>)</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align: center\">13</td><td>Grave in the village of Krezk (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=OWRkMTE5ZDk1Mjg2 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>ch. 8, area S3</a>)</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align: center\">14</td><td>Grave in Berez cemetery (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NTkwZjliZmMwNGQ2 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>ch. 10, area U4</a>)</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align: center\">15-16</td><td>Grave in the Svalich Woods (ch. 2, \"<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZDJhM2Y0MDc5M2Mw ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Random Encounters</a>\")</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align: center\">17-20</td><td>Corpse of one deceased player character or NPC, wherever it happens to be</td></tr></tbody></table><br>The spirit of the dragon Argynvost isn’t at rest, either. It can sense that the knights have been corrupted, and it reaches out to the characters, hoping they will help the knights find peace. If the characters retrieve the dragon’s skull from Castle Ravenloft and place it in the mausoleum of Argynvostholt, the dragon’s spirit ascends to the highest tower of the mansion and transforms into a beacon of light that flashes across Barovia. The light of the beacon reminds <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YjkzZjg3MTA0Zjlh ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Vladimir Horngaard</a> of what he has lost, enabling him and his fellow knights to let go of their hatred and find both redemption and rest.<br><h3></h3></section>","img":""}

After his work on the castle was complete, Khazan retired to the Barovian valley and built a tower for himself on a small island on Lake Baratok. With the help of some engineers and laborers, he also built an earth-and-gravel causeway connecting the island with the nearby shore.<br><br>In his waning years, Khazan visited the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZmRiYTJmZWRkNmVm ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Amber Temple</a> (chapter 13) and discovered the secret to becoming a lich. He returned to his tower and was able to complete the transformation. Some years later, after Strahd became a vampire, Khazan paid a visit to Castle Ravenloft with the notion of challenging Strahd for rulership of Barovia. Instead, much to Khazan’s surprise, Strahd persuaded him to serve as an advisor in matters of magic. When not advising Strahd, the lich spent most of his time in the Amber Temple, trying to master the secret of demilichdom in the hope of finding a way to magically project his spirit beyond the confines of Strahd’s realm. His efforts failed, and Khazan destroyed himself. His remains lie entombed in the catacombs of Ravenloft.<br><br>Khazan’s tower stood empty for ages, it seemed, and would have collapsed under the weight of neglect were it not for the magic wards placed on it long ago. Recently, the tower was taken over by the legendary vampire hunter <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MTY5MmZlODgzNzJi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Rudolph van Richten</a>, who used it as a base from which to explore Barovia.

{"_id":"MjNjMzQzYmU0NDgx","name":"Adventuring Gear","permission":{"default":0},"folder":"ZTU0NTQxMTA4NjVl","flags":{"R20Converter":{"handout-order":1,"handout-archived":false}},"sort":10000,"entryTime":0,"content":"<h2>Adventuring Gear</h2><br>This section describes items that have special rules or require further explanation.<br><strong><br>Acid</strong>: As an action, you can splash the contents of this vial onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw the vial up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the acid as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 acid damage.<br><strong><br>Alchemist’s Fire</strong>: This sticky, adhesive fluid ignites when exposed to air. As an action, you can throw this flask up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the alchemist's fire as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 1d4 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature can end this damage by using its action to make a DC 10 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames.<br><strong><br>Antitoxin</strong>: A creature that drinks this vial of liquid gains advantage on saving throws against poison for 1 hour. It confers no benefit to undead or constructs.<br><strong><br>Arcane Focus</strong>: An arcane focus is a special item— an orb, a crystal, a rod, a specially constructed staff, a wand-like length of wood, or some similar item— designed to channel the power of arcane spells. A sorcerer, warlock, or wizard can use such an item as a spellcasting focus.<br><strong><br>Ball Bearings</strong>: As an action, you can spill these tiny metal balls from their pouch to cover a level, square area that is 10 feet on a side. A creature moving across the covered area must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn’t need to make the save.<br><strong><br>Block and Tackle</strong>: A set of pulleys with a cable threaded through them and a hook to attach to objects, a block and tackle allows you to hoist up to four times the weight you can normally lift.<br><strong><br>Book</strong>: A book might contain poetry, historical accounts, information pertaining to a particular field of lore, diagrams and notes on gnomish contraptions, or just about anything else that can be represented using text or pictures. A book of spells is a spellbook (described later in this section).<br><strong><br>Caltrops</strong>: As an action, you can spread a bag of caltrops to cover a square area that is 5 feet on a side. Any creature that enters the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or stop moving this turn and take 1 piercing damage. Taking this damage reduces the creature’s walking speed by 10 feet until the creature regains at least 1 hit point. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn’t need to make the save.<br><strong><br>Candle</strong>: For 1 hour, a candle sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.<br><strong><br>Case, Crossbow Bolt</strong>: This wooden case can hold up to twenty crossbow bolts.<br><strong><br>Case, Map or Scroll</strong>: This cylindrical leather case can hold up to ten rolled-up sheets of paper or five rolled-up sheets of parchment.<br><strong><br>Chain</strong>: A chain has 10 hit points. It can be burst with a successful DC 20 Strength check.<br><strong><br>Climber’s Kit</strong>: A climber’s kit includes special pitons, boot tips, gloves, and a harness. You can use the climber’s kit as an action to anchor yourself; when you do, you can’t fall more than 25 feet from the point where you anchored yourself, and you can’t climb more than 25 feet away from that point without undoing the anchor.<br><strong><br>Component Pouch</strong>: A component pouch is a small, watertight leather belt pouch that has compartments to hold all the material components and other special items you need to cast your spells, except for those components that have a specific cost (as indicated in a spell's description).<br><strong><br>Crowbar</strong>: Using a crowbar grants advantage to Strength checks where the crowbar’s leverage can be applied.<br><strong><br>Druidic Focus</strong>: A druidic focus might be a sprig of mistletoe or holly, a wand or scepter made of yew or another special wood, a staff drawn whole out of a living tree, or a totem object incorporating feathers, fur, bones, and teeth from sacred animals. A druid can use such an object as a spellcasting focus.<br><strong><br>Fishing Tackle</strong>: This kit includes a wooden rod, silken line, corkwood bobbers, steel hooks, lead sinkers, velvet lures, and narrow netting.<br><strong><br>Healer’s Kit</strong>: This kit is a leather pouch containing bandages, salves, and splints. The kit has ten uses. As an action, you can expend one use of the kit to stabilize a creature that has 0 hit points, without needing to make a Wisdom (Medicine) check.<br><strong><br>Holy Symbol</strong>: A holy symbol is a representation of a god or pantheon. It might be an amulet depicting a symbol representing a deity, the same symbol carefully engraved or inlaid as an emblem on a shield, or a tiny box holding a fragment of a sacred relic. Pantheons lists the symbols commonly associated with many gods in the multiverse. A cleric or paladin can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus. To use the symbol in this way, the caster must hold it in hand, wear it visibly, or bear it on a shield.<br><strong><br>Holy Water</strong>: As an action, you can splash the contents of this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a target creature, treating the holy water as an improvised weapon. If the target is a fiend or undead, it takes 2d6 radiant damage. A cleric or paladin may create holy water by performing a special ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour to perform, uses 25 gp worth of powdered silver, and requires the caster to expend a 1st-level spell slot.<br><br><strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZWZhYmQ1MjNiY2Rj ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Hunting Trap</a></strong>: When you use your action to set it, this trap forms a saw-toothed steel ring that snaps shut when a creature steps on a pressure plate in the center. The trap is affixed by a heavy chain to an immobile object, such as a tree or a spike driven into the ground. A creature that steps on the plate must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d4 piercing damage and stop moving. Thereafter, until the creature breaks free of the trap, its movement is limited by the length of the chain (typically 3 feet long). A creature can use its action to make a DC 13 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Each failed check deals 1 piercing damage to the trapped creature.<br><strong><br>Lamp</strong>: A lamp casts bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil.<br><strong><br>Lantern, Bullseye</strong>: A bullseye lantern casts bright light in a 60-foot cone and dim light for an additional 60 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil.<br><strong><br>Lantern, Hooded</strong>: A hooded lantern casts bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil. As an action, you can lower the hood, reducing the light to dim light in a 5-foot radius.<br><strong><br>Lock</strong>: A key is provided with the lock. Without the key, a creature proficient with thieves’ tools can pick this lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. Your GM may decide that better locks are available for higher prices.<br><strong><br>Magnifying Glass</strong>: This lens allows a closer look at small objects. It is also useful as a substitute for flint and steel when starting fires. Lighting a fire with a magnifying glass requires light as bright as sunlight to focus, tinder to ignite, and about 5 minutes for the fire to ignite. A magnifying glass grants advantage on any ability check made to appraise or inspect an item that is small or highly detailed.<br><strong><br>Manacles</strong>: These metal restraints can bind a Small or Medium creature. Escaping the manacles requires a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. Breaking them requires a successful DC 20 Strength check. Each set of manacles comes with one key. Without the key, a creature proficient with thieves’ tools can pick the manacles’ lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. Manacles have 15 hit points.<br><strong><br>Mess Kit</strong>: This tin box contains a cup and simple cutlery. The box clamps together, and one side can be used as a cooking pan and the other as a plate or shallow bowl.<br><strong><br>Oil</strong>: Oil usually comes in a clay flask that holds 1 pint. As an action, you can splash the oil in this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a target creature or object, treating the oil as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target is covered in oil. If the target takes any fire damage before the oil dries (after 1 minute), the target takes an additional 5 fire damage from the burning oil. You can also pour a flask of oil on the ground to cover a 5-foot-square area, provided that the surface is level. If lit, the oil burns for 2 rounds and deals 5 fire damage to any creature that enters the area or ends its turn in the area. A creature can take this damage only once per turn.<br><strong><br>Poison, Basic</strong>: You can use the poison in this vial to coat one slashing or piercing weapon or up to three pieces of ammunition. Applying the poison takes an action. A creature hit by the poisoned weapon or ammunition must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or take 1d4 poison damage. Once applied, the poison retains potency for 1 minute before drying.<br><br><strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NDBhYzNmNWNmZDNl ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Potion of Healing</a></strong>: A character who drinks the magical red fluid in this vial regains 2d4 + 2 hit points. Drinking or administering a potion takes an action.<br><strong><br>Pouch</strong>: A cloth or leather pouch can hold up to 20 sling bullets or 50 blowgun needles, among other things. A compartmentalized pouch for holding spell components is called a component pouch (described earlier in this section).<br><strong><br>Quiver</strong>: A quiver can hold up to 20 arrows.<br><strong><br>Ram, Portable</strong>: You can use a portable ram to break down doors. When doing so, you gain a +4 bonus on the Strength check. One other character can help you use the ram, giving you advantage on this check.<br><strong><br>Rations</strong>: Rations consist of dry foods suitable for extended travel, including jerky, dried fruit, hardtack, and nuts.<br><strong><br>Rope</strong>: Rope, whether made of hemp or silk, has 2 hit points and can be burst with a DC 17 Strength check.<br><strong><br>Scale, Merchant’s</strong>: A scale includes a small balance, pans, and a suitable assortment of weights up to 2 pounds. With it, you can measure the exact weight of small objects, such as raw precious metals or trade goods, to help determine their worth.<br><strong><br>Spellbook</strong>: Essential for wizards, a spellbook is a leather-bound tome with 100 blank vellum pages suitable for recording spells.<br><strong><br>Spyglass</strong>: Objects viewed through a spyglass are magnified to twice their size.<br><strong><br>Tent</strong>: A simple and portable canvas shelter, a tent sleeps two.<br><strong><br>Tinderbox</strong>: This small container holds flint, fire steel, and tinder (usually dry cloth soaked in light oil) used to kindle a fire. Using it to light a torch—or anything else with abundant, exposed fuel—takes an action. Lighting any other fire takes 1 minute.<br><strong><br>Torch</strong>: A torch burns for 1 hour, providing bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. If you make a melee attack with a burning torch and hit, it deals 1 fire damage.<br><br><table>\n<caption><strong>Adventuring Gear</strong></caption>\n<thead><tr>\n<th>Item</th>\n<th

Burgomaster's Mansion</h2><blockquote>This mansion has walls of plastered stone that display many scars where the plaster has fallen away from age and neglect. Drapes cover every window, including a large, arched opening above the mansion’s double entrance doors.</blockquote><br>People come and go from the mansion at all hours during the day. Guards bring criminals cited for “malicious unhappiness.” Men and women arrive carrying bundles of twigs, which are piled about the mansion’s grand foyer (area N3a) until the construction of the wicker sun for the Festival of the Blazing Sun (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=N2M0MmM5ZjE3Mzdj ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Special Events: Chapter 5</a>) gets under way.<br><br>\nIf the characters knock on the front doors, a maid (LG female human <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OWYxMjNkNjFkMTdj ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>commoner</a></strong>) lets them in, escorts them to the den (area N3e), and leaves to fetch the baron.<br><br><h4>Roleplaying the Vallakovich Family</h4>Picture: <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MzgyYWM1YjdhYjA2 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Handout: Vallakovich Family</a><br><br>Use the following information to roleplay the burgomaster and his family.<br><br>\n<strong><em>The Baron.</em></strong> The burgomaster, <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OGQyM2MyNTQyN2Rm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Baron Vargas Vallakovich</a></strong> (NE male human), is a ruthless heel who prides himself on his good breeding and finely honed leadership skills. He stages repeated celebrations to foster happiness, and his “All will be well!” catchphrase has become a sad and tiresome punchline. Baron Vallakovich has convinced himself that if he can make everyone in Vallaki happy, the town will slip free of Strahd’s dark grasp.<br><br>\nThe baron has a brittle ego, and he lashes out at anyone who pokes fun at his festivals or treats him disrespectfully. He has two pet mastiffs that follow him everywhere, as well as a murderous and deformed henchman named <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OWI0OGEwMDg5M2Qy ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Izek Strazni</a></strong>. In addition to his weapons, Izek carries an iron ring of keys that unlock the stocks in the town square (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YWIzMjIyNzE0OGFk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area N8</a>).<br><br>\nIf the characters get on his bad side, the baron accuses them of being “spies of the devil Strahd” and sends twelve <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NGVjOTU0NmM3ODMy ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>guards</a></strong> to arrest them, seize their weapons, and run them out of town. If the guards fail in their duty, the baron sends Izek to rally a mob of thirty <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OWYxMjNkNjFkMTdj ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>commoners</a></strong> to lynch the party. If the commoners also fail, the baron summons the twelve remaining guards to defend his mansion, giving characters the run of the town.<br><br>\nIf the characters get on his good side, he insists that they join him in the next festival as special guests and asks that they tell everyone that all will, indeed, be well.<br><br>\nTwo members of the baron’s household staff have vanished in the past week: the butler and the baroness’s lady-in-waiting. The baron has charged Izek with finding out what happened to them, but investigation isn’t Izek’s forte. Searches have been organized, to no avail.<br><br>\n<strong><em>The Baroness.</em></strong> At the risk of sacrificing her sanity, the baron’s wife,<strong> <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=Y2IxMjA3MWU3MGQy ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Lady Lydia Petrovna</a></strong> (LG female human), has embraced her husband’s philosophy of happiness. She laughs at the baron’s every comment, to the extent that it has become a nervous reflex, and she tries to spread good cheer by throwing daily tea-and-sandwich parties in the parlor for her “dearest friends,” many of them poor folk who tolerate the baroness only because they crave something warm to eat and drink. Lydia is a gods-fearing woman and the younger sister of the town priest, Father Lucian Petrovich (see area N1, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YWIzMjIyNzE0OGFk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Areas of Vallaki</a>). She is a descendant of Tasha Petrovna, a priest entombed in Castle Ravenloft (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YzI0YTFjYTVjY2Jh ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Dungeon and Catacombs</a>).<br><br>\n<strong><em>The Baronet. </em></strong>The baron’s miserable son, <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZmNjYWE4YjQ0YWQ4 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Victor Vallakovich</a></strong> (NE male human), has confined himself to the attic (area N3t), where he is content to avoid the unwanted attention of his mother and the disapproving glares of his father. Years ago, Victor found an old spellbook in the mansion’s library and used it to teach himself magic. He has been busy constructing a <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=NmM1NzMyMzRhMmU2 ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>teleportation circle</a></em> in the hope of escaping Barovia and leaving his parents to their doom.<br><br><hr><br><h3>N3a. Entrance Hall and Vestibule</h3><blockquote>Framed portraits adorn the walls of this grand foyer, which features a wide staircase with a sculpted railing. A long, carpeted hall attached to the foyer stretches almost the length of the mansion and has several doors leading away from it, including one at the far end. Bundles of twigs are heaped against the walls.</blockquote><br>The twigs are being stored here until they can be fashioned into a wooden effigy of the sun (for the Festival of the Blazing Sun).<br><br>\nThe stairs climb to the upstairs gallery (area N3i).<br><br>\nThe portraits depict the baron, his family, and their ancestors. Close inspection reveals that some of the people portrayed look very much alike.<br><br>\nTucked in the northeast corner of the foyer is a vestibule packed with fine cloaks, coats, and boots.<br><br><hr><br><h3>N3b. Parlor</h3><blockquote>This parlor contains a fine array of furnishings and draperies, with an overall feminine touch.</blockquote><br>The baroness sometimes entertains guests here.<br><br><hr><br><h3>N3c. Dining Room</h3>Characters can hear the chatter of female voices as they approach this room. The first time they peer inside, read:<br><br><blockquote>A chandelier of wrought iron fitted with wax candles hangs above a polished wooden dining table. Around the table are seated eight women of various ages in comfortable, high-backed chairs. They wear faded clothes, drink tea, and devour cake while a ninth woman, well dressed and very pleased with herself, circles the table and talks excitedly about decorations for the impending festival.</blockquote><br>The women seated at the table are eight Vallakian peasants (LG female <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OWYxMjNkNjFkMTdj ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>commoners</a></strong>) invited to spend time with the baroness, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=Y2IxMjA3MWU3MGQy ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Lydia Petrovna</a>, who is bribing them with tea and cake. Lydia has assigned these women the task of stitching children’s costumes and weaving together a wicker sun for the Festival of the Blazing Sun.<br><br>\nLydia assumes that the characters are here at the invitation of her husband, the burgomaster. She calls for the maid to take them to the den (area N3e) and then to inform <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OGQyM2MyNTQyN2Rm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Baron Vallakovich</a> (see <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=N2VhNzc0NDhlZmVi ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area N2l</a>) that his guests have arrived.<br><br>\nA serving table stands in one corner of the dining hall.<br><br><hr><br><h3>N3d. Preparation Room</h3><blockquote>White sheets cover two plain wooden tables in the center of this room. Neatly arranged atop one table is a complete set of polished silverware. The other table is covered with wicker baskets containing turnips and beets.</blockquote><br>The beets and turnips are for the Festival of the Blazing Sun (see <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=N2M0MmM5ZjE3Mzdj ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Special Events: Chapter 5</a>).<br><br>\n<strong><em>Treasure. </em></strong>The silverware set is worth 150 gp.<br><br><hr><br><h3>N3e. Den</h3>Characters who ask to see the burgomaster are brought here.<br><br><blockquote>Padded chairs and couches line the walls of this cozy, carpeted den. The room reeks of pipe smoke, and mounted on the east wall is the head of an angry-looking brown bear.</blockquote><br>The mounted bear’s head is meant to unnerve visitors. It serves as a subtle warning not to antagonize the burgomaster, who spends most of his time in the library (area N3l). Although the burgomaster claims that his father killed the bear, the head was actually a gift given to his family by the late Szoldar Grygorovich, father of the wolf hunter <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZDVkMTQwY2YyYzkx ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Szoldar Szoldarovich</a> (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MmIxNGM4MWU0NTk0 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area N2</a>).<br><br><hr><br><h3>N3f. Servants' Quarters</h3><blockquote>This room contains four simple beds and an equal number of plain wooden trunks.</blockquote><br>The household staff consists of a maid (LG female human <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OWYxMjNkNjFkMTdj ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>commoner</a></strong>) and a cook (LG male human <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OWYxMjNkNjFkMTdj ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>commoner</a></strong>). The other two beds belonged to the butler and the baroness’s lady-in-waiting, both of whom have gone missing (see area N3t). The trunks contain the staff’s clothing and uniforms.<br><br><hr><br><h3>N3g. Kitchen</h3><blockquote>A cook wearing a white apron over a black smock busies himself in this warm, well-appointed kitchen. A staircase in one corner climbs to the upper floor.</blockquote><br>The staircase leads to the upstairs gallery (area N3i). A door in the west wall leads to a garden outside. The door is usually locked, and both the cook and the burgomaster carry keys to unlock it.<br><br><hr><br><h3>N3h. Pantry</h3><blockquote>This pantry contains shelves of foodstuffs, although half of the shelves are bare. Two barrels of wine stand against the east wall.</blockquote><br>The pantry has not been fully stocked for as long as anyone can remember. The two barrels contain a fine wine called Red Dragon Crush, created by the Wizard of Wines winery—facts burned into the side of each barrel.<br><br><hr><br><h3>N3i. Upstairs Gallery</h3>If the characters arrive here from the entrance hall (area N3a), read:<br><br><blockquote>The staircase climbs twenty feet to a beautifully appointed gallery that continues toward the west, running almost the length of the mansion. Framed landscape paintings line the walls, and red silk drapes cover a ten-foot-tall arched window of leaded glass.</blockquote><br>If the characters arrive here from the kitchen (area N3g), read:<br><br><blockquote>The staircase climbs to a ten-foot-wide gallery that stretches almost the length of the mansion. Breathtaking paintings of landscapes line the walls. Two separate, narrow hallways lead away from the gallery to the north.</blockquote><br><hr><br><h3>N3j. Izek's Bedroom</h3>The door to this room is locked. <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OWI0OGEwMDg5M2Qy ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Izek Strazni</a> carries the only key.<br><br>\nThe following description assumes the characters have met <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YjY2YzRmODJjYmNl ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Ireena Kolyana</a> (see chapter 3, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YWZmNWU5OGQ4ZmJl ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area E4</a>). If the characters haven’t met her, don’t read the last sentence.<br><br><blockquote>Dolls. This room is full of pretty little dolls with powder-white skin and auburn hair, some of them dressed beautifully, others plainly. Some of the dolls fill a long bookshelf, and others are arranged in neat rows on wall-mounted shelves. Still others are piled atop a bed and a heavy wooden chest. What’s most odd is that all of the dolls, apart from their clothing, look the same. They all look like Ireena Kolyana.</blockquote><br>The burgomaster’s monstrous henchman, <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OWI0OGEwMDg5M2Qy ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Izek Strazni</a></strong>, sleeps here at night. During the day, he is in town taking care of his master’s business. Izek’s chest is unlocked and contains a heap of wrinkled clothes, under which is a nonmagical shortsword.<br><br>\nA thorough search of the room reveals a few empty wine bottles under the bed. The label on each bears the winery’s name, the Wizard of Wines, and wine’s name, Purple Grapemash No. 3.<br><br>\n<strong><em>Izek’s Doll Collection. </em></strong>Each doll has a small tag stitched into its clothing that reads “Is No Fun, Is No Blinsky!” Izek had the local toymaker, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZDIzZTc1OWM5YTAz ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Gadof Blinsky</a> (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YWIzMjIyNzE0OGFk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area N7</a>), craft the dolls in Ireena’s likeness.<br><br><hr><br><h3>N3k. Victor's Bedroom</h3><blockquote>This handsomely appointed room contains a canopied bed, a low bookshelf, and a full-length mirror in a wooden frame on the wall across from the door. Set into the north wall is an arched window of leaded glass. Nothing here seems unusual.</blockquote><br>Nothing about his bedroom betrays Victor’s deviant nature or magical proclivities. The books include collections of Barovian fables and tomes about mythology, heraldry, and other innocuous subjects.<br><br><hr><br><h3>N3l. Library</h3><blockquote>Floor-to-ceiling shelves line every wall of this windowless room, and the number of books contained here is nothing short of astounding.<br><br>A brass oil lamp sits atop a large desk in the center of the room. The chair behind the desk is comfortably padded and has the symbol of a roaring bear stitched into its back cushion.</blockquote><br>If the burgomaster has not been drawn elsewhere, he is here. Add:<br><br><blockquote>Standing behind the chair, holding an open book, is a bear of a man. His breastplate, rapier, silk tunic, and greasy beard glisten in the lamplight. Resting on small rugs to his left and right are a pair of black mastiffs<br></blockquote><br><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OGQyM2MyNTQyN2Rm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Baron Vargas Vallakovich</a> never goes anywhere without his two <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NDJmOTg0M2ViYjg4 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>mastiffs</a></strong>. A paranoid man, he wears his breastplate and rapier even while relaxing in his library. Two of his servants, the butler and his wife’s lady-in-waiting, have vanished without a trace in the past week, so he has good cause to be worried.<br><br>\nThe baron believes that everyone else is beneath him, and those who question his word or challenge his authority must be humbled. He won’t pick a fight with well-armed strangers, however. If he can’t make the characters yield to his authority, he swallows his pride until he can circle around with Izek Strazni and assemble his guards to run them out of town.<br><br>\nThe baron’s desk contains three drawers stuffed with blank sheets of parchment, jars of ink, and writing quills. It also holds thick books of tax records dating back to the times of the baron’s father, grandfather, and great-grandfather.<br><br>\nThe baron wears a signet ring and carries three keys: one that unlocks the outside door in area N3g, and two keys for the door and the manacles in area N3m.<br><br>\n<strong><em>Treasure. </em></strong>The Vallakovich book collection contains old, leather-bound tomes on virtually every subject. Use the Random Books table (see <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZTM3NDAwZGFhNGE5 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Rooms of Weeping</a>, area K37) to determine the subject matter of a particular book.<br><br><hr><br><h3>N3m. Locked Closet</h3>The door to this room is locked. The baron carries the key.<br><br><blockquote>Chained to the back wall of this otherwise empty closet is a badly beaten man wearing nothing but a loincloth. The iron shackles have cut into his wrists, causing blood to trickle down his hands.</blockquote><br>The man is a Vallakian shoemaker named Udo Lukovich (LN male human <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OWYxMjNkNjFkMTdj ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>commoner</a></strong>). He was arrested during the Wolf’s Head Jamboree for carrying a sign that suggested that Vallakians should feed the baron to the wolves.<br><br>\nBaron Vallakovich has the key to Udo’s manacles. The manacles break if they take 10 damage or more from a single weapon attack.<br><br>If the characters release Udo, his first desire is to return to his home. Later, he plans to tell Father Lucian (see <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YWIzMjIyNzE0OGFk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area N1</a>) of his ill treatment in the burgomaster’s estate. If the baron discovers that Udo has escaped or been set free, he sends Izek to find the shoemaker and bring him back for further questioning. Under great duress, Udo provides the names or descriptions of those who liberated him, turning the burgomaster against the characters.<br><br><hr><br><h3>N3n. Master Bedroom Closet</h3><blockquote>Cloaks, coats, gowns, and other fancy apparel hang from hooks in this closet. Arranged on low shelves are many fine shoes, slippers, and boots.</blockquote><br><hr><br><h3>N3o. Master Bedroom</h3><blockquote>Time has faded the grandeur of this master bedroom. The furnishings have lost some of their color and splendor. A short pull-rope hangs from a wooden trapdoor in the ceiling.</blockquote><br>The baron and the baroness sleep in one bed at night. Nothing of value is kept here.<br><br>\nThe trapdoor in the ceiling can be pulled down to reveal an attic room (area N3r). An unfolding wooden ladder allows easy access.<br><br><hr><br><h3>N3p. Bridal Gown and Spirit Mirror</h3><blockquote>This room smells of powder and fine perfume. A vanity with a mirror stands against one wall next to a faceless wooden mannequin wearing a white bridal gown. Mounted on another wall is a full-length mirror with a gilded frame. A door in one corner leads to a garderobe.</blockquote><br>The baroness used to while away long hours in this room, fondling her perfume collection and searching for solace in her own reflection. Since her lady-in-waiting went missing several days ago, the baroness has spent almost no time here.<br><br>\n<strong><em>Bridal Gown. </em></strong>The white gown stored here belongs to the baroness. It reminds the her of happier times.<br><br>\n<strong><em>Magic Mirror.</em></strong> A <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=ZGFkZjk1MTVlNDI3 ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>detect magic</a></em> spell reveals that the gilded mirror on the wall radiates an aura of conjuration magic. None of the mansion’s current occupants are aware of this fact, because the mirror’s magic hasn’t been used in generations. Casting an <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=ZTE2YmJjZDliYTYw ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>identify</a></em> spell on the mirror reveals that an assassin’s ghost is magically bound to it. The spell also reveals the forgotten rhyme needed to summon the ghost:<br><br>\n<em>Magic mirror on the wall,</em><br>\n<em>Summon forth your shade;</em><br>\n<em>Night’s dark vengeance, heed my call</em><br>\n<em>And wield your murderous blade.<br></em><br>If a character discovers this rhyme, reveal <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=M2EyMDFiMWJkNmRi ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Handout: Forgotten Mirror Rhyme</a>.<br><br>The entity in the mirror is the spirit of a nameless assassin who once belonged to a secret society called the Ba’al Verzi. If a creature speaks the rhyme while standing within 5 feet of the mirror and staring at its own reflection, the assassin’s ghost appears nearby. The form that the spirit takes depends on the alignment of the one who summoned it:<br><br>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 20px\"><strong>Non-evil Summoner.</strong> If the summoner isn’t evil, the spirit assumes solid form, appearing as a darkly handsome thirty-year-old man with bloodshot eyes. He has the statistics of a<strong> <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MjQ3ODM4M2E1ZGZh ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>spirit assassin, non-evil</a></strong> but doesn’t speak, and he disappears into the ether if reduced to 0 hit points. The assassin’s summoner can command him to kill one living creature within Strahd’s domain that the summoner mentions by name. The assassin automatically knows the distance and direction to the named target. The assassin attacks any other creature that tries to prevent him from completing his assignment. Once he completes his task, the assassin disappears. If commanded to attack a creature that is either dead or undead, or if he isn’t given an appropriate name within 1 round of being summoned, the assassin disappears.<br><br><strong>Evil Summoner.</strong> If the summoner is evil, the ghost manifests as a pair of floating, bloodshot eyes and strong, spectral hands. The hands try to wrap themselves around the summoner’s neck. The <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YTA2MGI4ODljYmQy ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>spirit assassin, evil</a></strong> attacks its summoner until one or the other drops to 0 hit points, at which point it disappears.</div><br>\nOnce the power of the mirror is used, the mirror becomes dormant until the next dawn. The mirror has AC 10, 5 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Destroying it lays the assassin’s spirit to rest, causing the manifestation to disappear if it is present.<br><br>\nThe mirror corrupts those who use it to do evil. Summoning the assassin isn’t evil, but using him to commit murder is. Each time a creature uses the mirror for this purpose, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance that the creature’s alignment shifts to neutral evil.<br><br>\nIf a character touches the mirror and speaks Strahd’s name, there is a 50 percent chance that <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTZiYzA5N2ViNTZi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Strahd</a> takes notice and appears on the mirror’s surface. In this form, the vampire can’t be harmed. He tries to charm one humanoid he can see within 30 feet of the mirror. Whether the target resists the effect or not, Strahd’s smiling visage invites the characters to dine at Castle Ravenloft, then fades away. A creature charmed by Strahd feels compelled to accept the vampire’s invitation.<br><br><hr><br><h3>N3q. Bathroom</h3><blockquote>An iron tub with clawed feet stands against the back wall. Neatly folded towels rest atop a table near the door.<br></blockquote><br><hr><br><h3>N3r. Attic Room</h3>Characters are most likely to enter this room via a trapdoor in the ceiling of the master bedroom (area N3o).<br><br><blockquote>This dusty, twenty-foot-square room has a high-pitched ceiling that reaches its peak twenty feet above. The wooden rafters are shrouded in cobwebs. Except for an old table with a lantern on it, the room is empty.</blockquote><br>A door in the south wall can be pulled open to area N3s.<br><br><hr><br><h3>N3s. Attic Storage</h3><blockquote>This large attic is full of old, forgotten things draped in white sheets. Piled around them are barrels, crates, trunks, and old furnishings covered with cobwebs and dust. You see a clear footpath through the maze.</blockquote><br>Characters can follow a single set of human footprints in the dust that lead to area N3t.<br><br>\nSearching through the junk in this attic uncovers a few old paintings and antiques, but nothing of value.<br><br><h4><span style=\"color: rgb( 99 , 36 , 35 )\">Fortunes of Ravenloft</span></h4>If your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, the item is hidden in a trunk. Each character has a cumulative 20 percent chance of finding the item for every hour the character spends searching the attic.<br><br><hr><br><h3>N3t. Victor's Workroom</h3>Victor spends most of his time here, leaving only when he needs food or spell components. When the characters first set eyes on the door to this room, read:<br><br><blockquote>Someone has carved a large skull into this door. Hanging from the doorknob is a wooden sign that reads “ALL IS NOT WELL!” You hear a young man’s voice beyond.</blockquote><br>Anyone who inspects the carving and succeeds on a DC 14 Intelligence (Investigation) check notices a small, nearly invisible glyph etched into the skull’s forehead. This is a <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=ODA4ZGM2NjUxZGU1 ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>glyph of warding</a></em> (5d8 lightning damage) that triggers if anyone other than Victor opens the door.<br><br>\nThe voice belongs to Victor. He is reading aloud from his spellbook. Anyone who listens at the door and succeeds on a DC 14 Intelligence (Arcana) check can tell he’s badly pronouncing some kind of teleportation spell.<br><br>\nIf the characters open the door, read:<br><br><blockquote>Someone has taken old, mismatched furniture and created a study is this dusty, lamplit chamber. Tables are strewn with pieces of parchment, on which strange diagrams are drawn, and a freestanding bookshelf holds a collection of bones. A dusty rug covers the floor in front of a pine box, on which lounges a skeletal cat. Several more skeletal cats skulk about. Most unnerving of all is the sight of three small children standing with their backs to you in the northeast corner of the room.</blockquote><br>If the characters trigger the <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=ODA4ZGM2NjUxZGU1 ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>glyph of warding</a></em> or otherwise announce their arrival, Victor casts a<em> <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=M2U1NGE5OWMxMjUz ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>greater invisibility</a></em> spell on himself and hides in a corner. Otherwise, he’s visible. If the characters can see Victor, read:<br><br><blockquote>In the center of the room, perched on a stool, is a thin young man with a premature streak of gray in his dark hair. He cradles an open leather-bound book in his arms.</blockquote><br>Victor found a spellbook in his father’s library and is using it to teach himself the art of spellcasting. Only recently has he been able to decipher some of its high-level spells. He’s a weird, awkward, and off-putting fellow who is dangerous only if threatened.<br><br>\nFor practice and for fun, Victor dug up some old cat bones behind the Wachter estate (see area N4) and animated them, creating six<strong> <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NjllOWIxYmE3Mjgz ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>skeletal cats</a></strong>. The skeletons attack only when Victor commands them to.<br><br>\nThe “children” standing in the corner are painted wooden dolls dressed in clothing that Victor wore as a child. He pretends they are his disobedient pupils.<br><br>\nThe sheets of parchment are covered with elaborate diagrams of teleportation circles. Victor drew them in an effort to learn the<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=NmM1NzMyMzRhMmU2 ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i> </a><em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=NmM1NzMyMzRhMmU2 ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>teleportation circle</a></em> spell, which he’s still trying to master (see “Teleportation Circle” below).<br><br>\nThe trunk contains several bolts of silk cloth, needles and thread, and a half-finished wizard’s robe. Victor started to make the robe for himself but found the work tedious and stopped.<br><br>\n<strong><em>Teleportation Circle.</em></strong> Victor’s spellbook contains incomplete text for a <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=NmM1NzMyMzRhMmU2 ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>teleportation circle</a></em> spell, along with the sigil sequences of three permanent teleportation circles, the locations of which aren’t described. There’s not enough text to prepare the spell properly, but that hasn’t stopped Victor from trying to learn to cast it.<br><br>\nVictor recently inscribed his own version of a teleportation circle on the floor. It’s hidden under the rug so that his parents don’t find it. In the past couple of weeks, Victor has managed to imbue the circle with magic, but he failed to account for several factors. His circle doesn’t fade after use, nor does it function like the <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=NmM1NzMyMzRhMmU2 ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>teleportation circle</a></em> spell. If the circle is used in the casting of a <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=NmM1NzMyMzRhMmU2 ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>teleportation circle</a></em> spell, whether the actual spell or Victor’s version of it, any creature standing on the circle when the spell is cast takes 3d10 force damage and isn’t teleported anywhere. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 hit points, the creature is disintegrated. Any character who studies the circle and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check realizes that Victor’s circle is horribly flawed and potentially deadly when used.<br><br>\nVictor has tested his circle on two reluctant servants (compelled by his <em>suggestion</em> spell), in both cases linking his circle to one of the other circles whose sigils are in his spellbook. Each servant was torn apart before Victor’s eyes before vanishing in a flash of purple light. Victor doesn’t know how to fix the circle but plans to make more modifications to it before testing it again.<br><br><strong><em>Treasure. </em></strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZmNjYWE4YjQ0YWQ4 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Victor Vallakovich's</a> spellbook contains all the spells Victor has prepared as well as the following spells: <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=MWU4ZWU3ZTJmY2Zh ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>acid splash</a></em>, <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=NWM5OTdhOGFkYjUw ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>animate dead</a></em>, <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=MzVmMTdiYjU2NmFh ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>blight</a></em>, <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=MDc5YjU3ZmRiMjA3 ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>cloudkill</a></em>, <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=ZTk2NzNjOTFiMmQ5 ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>darkvision</a></em>, <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=ODA4ZGM2NjUxZGU1 ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>glyph of warding</a></em>, <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=MDU1ZjVkYjFlNjY0 ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>levitate</a></em>, <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=NzI0YmVlNmJhMmRi ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>mending</a></em>, <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=Yzg0NGFmODc4NDdl ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>remove curse</a></em>, and <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=NjU1OWJlNzdiYjdh ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>thunderwave</a></em>.<br></section>","img":"modules/cor-cos/journal/005_-_Chapter_5_3A_The_Town_of_Vallaki/006_-_Burgomaster_27s_Mansion/avatar.webp"}
{"_id":"MmIyZjFmYmJlZDZj","name":"Abbey of Saint Markovia Ground Floor","permission":{"default":0},"folder":"MjM5MjEzZGY1NWFk","flags":{"R20Converter":{"handout-order":2,"handout-archived":false}},"sort":20000,"entryTime":0,"content":"\n<section class=\"secret\"><p>GM Notes : </p><h2>Areas of the Abbey</h2>The following areas correspond to labels on the maps of the Abbey of Saint Markovia (above).<br><br>The mongrelfolk that infest the abbey are all descendants of one family—the Belviews—and all suffer from some form of madness. Whenever the characters interact with a mongrelfolk who isn’t detailed here, roll on the Indefinite Madness table (in the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZDY1OWMzM2NkMDU2 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Madness</a> handout) or choose from the available options on the table to determine how that particular mongrelfolk’s madness is expressed.<br><br>Most of the mongrelfolk in the abbey are locked up because they can’t be trusted to wander about unsupervised. The only mongrelfolk who are free to move about are the Abbot’s gravediggers, Otto and Zygfrek, and his faithful, two-headed manservant, Clovin.<br><br><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTRkM2MwNGVjZGVk ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Clovin Belview</a> rings the abbey’s bell (area S17) when the Abbot decides it’s time for dinner. The toll of the bell causes all the other mongrelfolk in the abbey to hoot and holler with excitement as they wait to be fed.<br><br>The windows of the north wing are made of leaded glass that is translucent—good for letting in light but not good for seeing through. The windows of the east wing are broken outward and have damaged shutters.<br><br><hr><br><h3>S6. North Gate</h3><blockquote>The road from the village climbs above the mist to the wide ledge on which the abbey is perched. A light dusting of snow covers the trees and the rocky earth.<br><br>The gravel road passes between two small, stone outbuildings, to either side of which stretches a five-foot-high, three-foot-thick wall of jumbled stones held together with mortar. Blocking the road are iron gates attached to the outbuildings by rusty hinges. They appear to be unlocked. Viewed through the gates, the stone abbey stands quiet. Its two wings are joined by a fifteen-foot-high curtain wall. A belfry protrudes from the rooftop of the closer north wing, which also sports a chimney billowing gray smoke.</blockquote><br>The iron gates are unlocked but squeal loudly when someone opens them.<br><br>Two gate guards are on duty, but they aren’t awake when the characters arrive (see below). Characters who succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity (Stealth) check can climb over the low outer wall without waking them. If one or more characters fail the check, or if the characters open the gates, the guards rouse themselves and stumble forth to confront the trespassers.<br><br>The gate guards are <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MWEzNjVkMDQ3MWVk ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Otto Belview</a></strong> and <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTBmOTY2NzM3MWQ1 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Zygfrek Belview</a></strong>, two lawful evil <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTgwYWMxZDZhZTMx ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>mongrelfolk</a></strong>. They sleep under piles of musty animal furs. Both are loyal servants of the Abbot, yet not so good at guarding. If the characters seem friendly, the mongrelfolk escort them to the courtyard (area S12) and ask the characters to wait there while they fetch the Abbot (area S13). If the characters seem hostile, the mongrelfolk let them enter but don’t accompany them willingly.<br><br>Hanging on the inside wall of each guard post is a net woven from twigs and pine needles, as well as a shovel. Otto and Zygfrek cover themselves with the nets when they skulk through the village at night in search of fresh graves to dig up.<br><br><h4>Roleplaying the Mongrelfolk</h4>Use the information below to roleplay the mongrelfolk guards, Otto and Zygfrek.<br><br><strong><em>Otto Belview.</em></strong> Otto is 4 feet, 9 inches tall and squats instead of standing upright. He looks like a beardless dwarf with patches of donkey flesh covering his face and body. He has one human ear and one wolf’s ear, and a protruding wolf’s snout and fangs. His arms and hands are human, but his legs and feet are leonine, and he has a donkey’s tail. He can barely speak Common, and his laugh sounds like a donkey’s bray. He wears a plain wool cloak.<br><br>Otto has the Standing Leap feature. His madness is embodied in the following statement: “I am the smartest, wisest, strongest, fastest, and most beautiful person I know.”<br><br><strong><em>Zygfrek Belview.</em></strong> Zygfrek stands 4 feet, 7 inches tall. The left side of her face and body is covered with lizard scales, the right with tufts of gray wolf fur. Between these tufts is pale human skin. One of her eyes is that of a feline, and her fingers and hands resemble cat’s paws with opposable thumbs. She has a gruff voice and wears a gray cloak with black fur trim.<br><br>Zygfrek has the Darkvision feature. Her madness is embodied in the following statement: “I don’t like the way people judge me all the time.”<br><br><hr><br><h3>S7. Graveyard</h3><blockquote>Stunted pine trees grow out of the rocky earth in the graveyard near the foundation of the abbey’s north wing. The windows of the structure are cracked panes of leaded glass. Ancient gravestones burst from a thin crust of snow in the yard. Beyond the low wall that surrounds the graveyard, the ground falls away. The village lies four hundred feet below, and the view is breathtaking.</blockquote><br>Carved into each gravestone is the name of a long-dead priest or nun. Some of the names include Brother Martek, Brother Valen, Sister Constance, and Sister Lenora.<br><br><h4>Sun’s Grave</h4>The gravestone marked X is carved with roses and bears a 3-inch-diameter sun-shaped indentation on its east side. Engraved beneath the indentation is the name Petrovna. If Tasha Petrovna’s holy symbol (see chapter 4, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YzI0YTFjYTVjY2Jh ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K84</a>, crypt 11) is placed in the indentation, both the holy symbol and the indentation vanish. Then read:<br><br><blockquote>A ray of golden sunlight breaks through the clouds to the west and shines upon the grave. The fog and the gloom shrink from its brilliance as the sunlight causes the gravestone to crack and crumble, revealing a ring within.</blockquote><br>The sunray lasts for 1 minute. If the characters smash the gravestone without placing Tasha Petrovna’s holy symbol in it first, they find nothing within its remains.<br><br>The ring is a <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YjNkMzVhZjg2NTNh ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i><em>ring of regeneration</em></a>.<br><br><hr><br><h3>S8. Garden Gatehouse</h3><blockquote>A gatehouse stands at the entrance to the abbey gardens.</blockquote><br>The gatehouse is empty.<br><br><hr><br><h3>S9. Gardens</h3><blockquote>Nestled between rising and plunging cliffs are four rectangular garden plots enclosed by a five-foot-high wall of mortared stones. White rabbits nibble on turnips uprooted by the cold. Two lifeless scarecrows with stuffed gullets and sackcloth heads hang from wooden crosses pounded into the cold, hard earth.</blockquote><br>If the characters haven’t cleared out the east wing, add:<br><br><blockquote>The abbey’s east wing looms over the garden, its shattered windows dark and disturbing. A door leads into this forlorn edifice, which apparently isn’t as abandoned as one might have hoped. From within come the laughter and the wailing of things that should not be.</blockquote><br>The rabbits and the scarecrows are harmless. The gardens contain a meager assortment of root vegetables and squash. The door leading to area S15 isn’t locked.<br><br><h4><span style=\"color: rgb( 99 , 36 , 35 )\">Fortunes of Ravenloft</span></h4>If your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, the item is hidden in the straw-filled gullet of the southernmost scarecrow. If the treasure is removed from the scarecrow, seven <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YzUzY2VhZmYxZDFh ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>wights</a></strong> erupt from the gardens and attack. They wear tattered livery of Strahd’s house.<br><br><hr><br><h3>S10. Abbey Entrance</h3><blockquote>A fifteen-foot-high curtain wall joins the abbey’s two wings. Behind its battlements, two guards stand at attention, their features obscured by fog. Below them, set into the wall, is a pair of ten-foot-tall, wooden doors reinforced with bands of steel. To the right of these doors, mounted on the wall, is a tarnished copper plaque.</blockquote><br>The plaque bears the abbey’s name, under which appear these words: “May her light cure all illness.”<br><br>The “guards” on the wall are propped-up scarecrows that wear corroded chain shirts and clutch rusted spears (see area S18). A character who succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check discerns the charade.<br><br>The double doors are heavy but unlocked. They can be pushed open to reveal a foggy courtyard (area S12).<br><br><hr><br><h3>S11. Inner Gatehouses</h3>These two empty buildings help support the curtain wall (area S18) that encloses the courtyard (area S12). The wooden doors that lead to them are unlocked.<br><br><hr><br><h3>S12. Courtyard</h3><blockquote>The thick fog that fills this courtyard swirls, as if eager to escape. The courtyard is surrounded by a fifteen-foot-high curtain wall on which stand several guards with their backs to you—or so it seemed at first. It’s clear now that these guards are merely scarecrows.<br><br>Wooden doors to the north and east lead to the abbey’s two wings. In the center of the courtyard is a stone well fitted with an iron winch, to which a rope and bucket are attached. Along the perimeter, tucked under the overhanging wall, are several stone sheds with padlocked wooden doors, as well as three shallow alcoves that contain wooden troughs. Two wooden posts pounded into the rocky earth have iron rings bolted to them, and chained to one of them is a short humanoid with bat wings and spider mandibles.<br><br>The quiet is shattered by horrible screams coming from the sheds.</blockquote><br>If the characters are escorted here by Otto and Zygfrek Belview (area S6), they are asked to wait in the courtyard while the mongrelfolk fetch the Abbot from area S13.<br><h4></h4><h4>S12a. Well</h4>The well is 80 feet deep. Hiding 20 feet down is a chaotic evil mongrelfolk named <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NmZjZDhhNWEyOTll ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Mishka Belview</a></strong>. He clings to the wall of the shaft and scuttles up to attack anyone who shines a light down on him.<br><br><strong><em>Mishka Belview.</em></strong> Mishka stands 5 feet tall and has a wiry, spindly build. He has three red spider eyes on the right side of his face, while the left side appears human. He has a frog’s foot in place of his left hand and a taloned crow’s foot where his right foot should be.<br><br>He has the Spider Climb feature. In his madness, he’s discovered he enjoys killing people.<br><br><h4>S12b. Old Troughs</h4>These three horse troughs are badly rotted and fall apart if handled or jostled.<br><br><h4>S12c. Chicken Sheds</h4>Each of these sheds is fitted with an iron padlock. <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTRkM2MwNGVjZGVk ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Clovin Belview</a> (area S17) carries the keys to these locks.<br><br>If the characters open a shed, read:<br><br><blockquote>This shed holds the shattered remains of several chicken coops. Shackled to the back wall is a wretched humanoid with bestial deformities.</blockquote><br>There are nine of these sheds, each one containing a howling or mewling <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTgwYWMxZDZhZTMx ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>mongrelfolk</a></strong>.<br><br><h4>S12d. Tethering Posts</h4>Iron rings bolted to these wooden posts were once used to secure horses. <br>Chained to one post is a chaotic neutral<strong> </strong>mongrelfolk<strong> </strong>named <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NjdiYWJiN2Y3MDc4 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Marzena Belview</a></strong>, the older sister of <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NmZjZDhhNWEyOTll ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Mishka Belview</a> (see area S12a).<br><br>If the characters approach Marzena, read:<br><br><blockquote>The creature chained to the post flaps its leathery wings and takes to the air, but doesn’t get far before its chains go taut. She flutters about madly, screaming nonsense. </blockquote><br><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NjdiYWJiN2Y3MDc4 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Marzena Belview</a> is skittish and afraid of everyone and everything except for <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTRkM2MwNGVjZGVk ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Clovin Belview</a> (area S17), whom she allows to come close enough to feed her.<br><br><strong><em>Marzena Belview.</em></strong> Marzena stands 4 feet, 5 inches tall and has a hunched posture. Long, stringy black hair hides much of her face, but clearly visible are the spider mandibles and teeth that replace her human mouth. She has the arms and wings of a bat, as well as a cloven hoof in place of her right foot. She doesn’t allow anyone to get close enough to undo her shackles, but if her bonds are magically unlocked or if her chains are somehow broken, she flies away and never returns.<br><br>Marzena has the Flight feature. Her madness is embodied in the following statement: “I am convinced that powerful enemies are hunting me, and their agents are everywhere I go. I am sure they’re watching me all the time.”<br><hr><br><h3>S13. Main Hall</h3><blockquote>Gentle-sounding music trickles down from above, played on a single stringed instrument by some unseen master.<br><br>The ground floor is one large, fifty-foot-square room with arched, leaded glass windows. A cauldron sits on an iron rack above a fire in a hearth, while above the fireplace mantel hangs a golden disk engraved with the symbol of the sun. In one corner, a wooden staircase climbs to the upper level, while in another corner a stone staircase descends into darkness.<br><br>Several chairs surround a wooden table that stretches nearly the length of the room. Wooden dishware and gold candelabras are neatly arranged on the table, standing behind which is a young woman with alabaster skin dressed in a torn and soiled red gown. Her auburn hair is neatly bundled so as not to touch her soft shoulders. She seems lost in her own thoughts.</blockquote><br>The Abbot is normally here. If he is here, add:<br><br><blockquote>A handsome young man in a brown monk’s robe gently takes the woman by her hand. A painted wooden holy symbol that depicts the sun hangs from a chain around his neck. He moves with the grace of a saint.</blockquote><p><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YzY2YTNiNmZjYmZj ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i><strong>The Abbot</strong></a> is a deva in disguise (see “Something Old” in <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=Y2M5NDc1MmRhMWE1 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Special Events: Chapter 8</a>). He wears a holy symbol of the Morninglord around his neck. The woman in the tattered red gown is <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NGY5ZTkwY2ZmNjli ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Vasilka</a></strong>, a flesh golem that has been exquisitely put together to serve as Strahd’s bride. Characters within 5 feet of Vasilka can see the seams in her powdered skin where disparate body parts stolen from Krezkite graves have been carefully stitched together.</p><br>The Abbot is teaching Vasilka the finer points of etiquette. He also intends to teach her how to dance. Vasilka obeys his every command. She can’t speak but lets loose an unholy scream if harmed. If driven berserk, she fights until the Abbot reasserts control or until she is destroyed. She has the supernatural strength of a typical flesh golem despite her smaller size.<br><br>The Abbot has no desire to harm the characters. He knows that Strahd has brought them to Barovia for a reason and doesn’t want to thwart Strahd’s plans for them. His calm, pleasant demeanor changes if they become hostile or if they threaten Vasilka. He sheds his disguise and assumes his true angelic form, hoping that sight is enough to make them back down.<br><br>The Abbot would like to find a proper bridal gown for Vasilka. If the characters seem friendly, he asks them for help in locating one. In exchange, he offers his magic, agreeing to cast <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=ZWZiODVmNDJiNGU2 ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>raise dead</a></em> up to three times on their behalf, or give them each the benefit of his healing touch. If they decline to help or behave rudely, he orders them to leave the abbey at once, attacking them if they refuse and doing his utmost to keep Vasilka safe.<br><br>The music comes from upstairs (area S17). The stone staircase leads down to the wine cellar (area S16). The wooden stairs climb to the loft and belfry (area S17).<br><br>The stew pot in the fireplace contains several gallons of hot turnip and rabbit soup, intended for the mongrelfolk imprisoned in areas S12c and S15.<br><br><h4>Roleplaying the Abbot</h4><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YzY2YTNiNmZjYmZj ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>The Abbot</a> believes he is righteous. He regrets transforming the Belviews into horrid mongrelfolk, and he considers their imprisonment to be necessary, to contain their madness. With regard to Strahd’s bride, he believes that she is the key to freeing the land from its curse. The insane Abbot can’t be convinced otherwise.<br><br>The Abbot shares his beliefs openly, claiming that his decisions are based on the Morninglord’s guidance. He will give visitors a tour of the abbey if they seem friendly, but he turns hostile if they threaten him or his charges.<br><br><h4>Treasure</h4>The golden sun disk hanging above the fireplace is worth 750 gp. Taking the disk off the wall reveals a niche that contains a <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NDBhYzNmNWNmZDNl ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i><em>potion of superior healing</em></a> in a crystal and electrum flask (worth 250 gp). Four gold candelabras (worth 250 gp each) rest atop the table.<br><br><h4><span style=\"color: rgb( 99 , 36 , 35 )\">Fortunes of Ravenloft</span></h4>If your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it is hidden in the niche along with the potion.<br><br><hr><br><h3>S14. Foyer</h3><blockquote>This room used to be an office, as evidenced by the remains of a desk and a chair, both of which have been smashed to pieces. A hallway to the south leads to a staircase going up. A dark passage to the east is full of unnatural whispers, mad laughter, and bestial odors.</blockquote><br>The stairs lead up to area S20.<br><br>If the characters enter this area making noise or carrying light sources, the golem in area S15 is drawn to them (unless they have already defeated it).<br><br><hr><br><h3>S15. Madhouse</h3><blockquote>This lightless corridor has multiple doors behind which lie creatures that shatter the quiet with their mad cackles and whispered curses. The stench is overpowering.</blockquote><br>Before he set out to create a bride for Strahd, the Abbot tried his hand at creating a more rudimentary golem. This creature paces the hall, tirelessly guarding the abbey’s madhouse and making sure no mongrelfolk escape. When the characters first see the golem, read:<br><br><blockquote>Even in the gloom, you can make out a monstrous shape lumbering down the hall. When the darkness can no longer hide its true nature, your eyes are treated to a terrifying, 7-foot-tall assemblage of human body parts.<br></blockquote>This <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZDU5M2NjNzgyNjhi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>flesh golem</a></strong> attacks anyone who isn’t in the company of the Abbot or Clovin Belview.<br><br>None of the doors leading from the hall are locked. If the characters open any and look inside, they see that the rooms on each side of the hall are dimly lit by natural light that filters through dirty, shuttered windows. The door at the east end of the hall leads outside and can be pulled open to reveal the gardens (area S9).<br><br>The sixty <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTgwYWMxZDZhZTMx ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>mongrelfolk</a></strong> confined here are fed at irregular intervals by Clovin Belview. Dinner is foretold by the ringing of the abbey bell (area S17). These mongrelfolk aren’t restrained, but they refuse to leave their rooms for fear of being killed by the golem or cast out of the abbey and forced to fend for themselves. In addition to a dagger, each mongrelfolk has its own wooden soup bowl.<br><br><h4>S15a. Fearful Mongrelfolk</h4><blockquote>This room was once a shared bedchamber, but its furnishings have been destroyed. Three shrieking mongrels cower in the shadowy northwest corner. One of them cradles something shiny.<br></blockquote><br>Three <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTgwYWMxZDZhZTMx ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>mongrelfolk</a></strong> are confined here. One of them cradles a polished brass candlestick as if it was a doll. Any attempt to take it causes the mongrelfolk to attack.<br><br><h4>S15b. Quarreling Mongrelfolk</h4><blockquote>Four mongrel creatures brawl amid the wreckage of this bedchamber while a fifth watches and cackles behind a life-sized, painted wooden statue of a saintly woman in robes.</blockquote><br>Five <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTgwYWMxZDZhZTMx ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>mongrelfolk</a></strong> are confined here. The four that are fighting aren’t trying to kill each other, but they are trying to assert dominance. They stop fighting if a character separates them.<br><br>The statue is a little over 5 feet tall and carved from a single piece of wood. It depicts Saint Markovia. Close inspection reveals that it is covered with bite marks.<br><br><h4>S15c. Incanting Mongrelfolk</h4><blockquote>Seven mongrels are seated in the middle of this room, forming a ring. They appear to be chanting a spell.</blockquote><br>These seven <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTgwYWMxZDZhZTMx ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>mongrelfolk</a></strong> are trying to cast a spell that will cause the abbey’s bell to ring, so that dinner will be served. They are speaking nonmagical gibberish.<br><br><h4>S15d. Hungry Mongrelfolk</h4><blockquote>Nine mongrel creatures stand in the middle of this room, starting at the doorway in silence with hungry looks in their eyes.</blockquote><br>These nine <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTgwYWMxZDZhZTMx ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>mongrelfolk</a></strong> haven’t been fed in days because Clovin doesn’t like them. They try to kill and devour any character who sets foot in the room.<br><br><h4>S15e. Mongrelfolk Horde</h4><blockquote>This room is packed wall to wall with mongrels wallowing in their own filth. The floor is strewn with gnawed bones.</blockquote><br>Sixteen screaming <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTgwYWMxZDZhZTMx ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>mongrelfolk</a></strong> are confined here. The bones are all that remain of mongrelfolk who perished and were eaten. The survivors beg for food.<br><br><h4>S15f. Singing and Dancing Mongrelfolk</h4><br><blockquote>Eight mongrels caper about the wreckage of this bedchamber while singing a rhyme. One of them holds up a glittering gold statuette as it leads this mad parade.</blockquote><br>The eight <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTgwYWMxZDZhZTMx ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>mongrelfolk</a></strong> sing the following rhyme:<br><br><em>The devil dwells in his dark house,<br>Upon the misty pillar.<br>First he’ll taste her sweet, sweet blood,<br>And then he’ll have to kill her.</em><br><br>They weep if their treasure is taken from them.<br><br><strong><em>Treasure.</em> </strong>The golden statuette depicts Saint Markovia and is worth 250 gp. It grants any good-aligned creature that carries it a +1 bonus to saving throws.<br><br><h4>S15g. Mongrelfolk Babies</h4><blockquote>Filthy mongrels cradle screaming young in the debris-strewn corners of this room while several more hoot, holler, roll on the floor, and whack each other with sticks.</blockquote><br>This room contains ten <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTgwYWMxZDZhZTMx ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>mongrelfolk</a></strong>, three of which are tendng to noncombatant mongrelfolk babies.<br><br><h4>S15h. Mongrelfolk Fort</h4><blockquote>This room contains a fort made out of piled bits of shattered furniture and torn draperies. From within the fort, you hear a mischievous cackle.</blockquote><br>Two <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTgwYWMxZDZhZTMx ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>mongrelfolk</a></strong> live in the “fort” but refuse to come out unless baited with food.

Curtained Staircase</h3>A tattered black curtain conceals an archway leading to a spiral staircase that descends to <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZmJhY2Q0N2E0MTgz ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area Q17</a>.<br><br>\nAt the top of the stairs is a secret door that can be pulled open to reveal area Q36 beyond.<br><br><hr><h3>Q31. East Staircases</h3>A round-topped wooden door opens to reveal a spiral staircase with narrow windows set into its walls. The stair connects the third floor and the mansion’s roof.<br><br><hr><br><h3>Q32. Ruined Bedchambers</h3>These two rooms stand across from each other, separated by a ruined corridor that abruptly ends to the south of their doors.<br><br><blockquote>Most of this chamber has collapsed. The wooden floor is strewn with rubble and falls away into a foggy abyss to the south. The roof overhead is jagged and broken.</blockquote><br>The floor here is 40 feet above of the floor of the ballroom (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=OGZkMWVkZjExOTc5 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area Q4</a>). The roof is 20 feet overhead.<br><hr><br><h3>Q33. Collapsed Ceiling</h3><blockquote>The roof over this part of the mansion has collapsed, creating a twenty-foot-diameter gaping hole with broken rafters bisecting it. Dark storm clouds roll across the sky overhead. The floor is piled with rocks, broken tiles, shattered beams, and other debris. Beneath the rubble lie a sagging floor and puddles of rainwater.</blockquote><br>The ceiling here is 20 feet high, and the rubble is difficult terrain.<br><br>\nVladimir Horngaard (see area Q36) can hear visitors climbing over the rubble and can’t be surprised by them.<br><hr><br><h3>Q34. Ruined Bathroom</h3><blockquote>This room has a tiled floor and an iron bathtub filled with debris from the collapsed roof. A torn curtain hangs in an open doorway in the center of the east wall.<br></blockquote><br><hr><br><h3>Q35. Upstairs Gallery</h3><blockquote>This room has dark wood paneling on the walls that rises to a height of three feet. Above the paneling, the walls are painted with murals of religious figures performing holy rites. In the center of the west wall is a tattered curtain hanging in an open doorway. Three tall, slender stained-glass windows set into the opposite wall depict figures in white robes with orange sunrises behind their heads.</blockquote><br>From north to south, the three stained-glass windows portray Saint Andral, the Morninglord, and Saint Markovia.<br><br><hr><br><h3>Q36. Dragon's Audience Hall</h3><blockquote>The west wall of this fifty-foot-long, thirty-foot-wide audience hall has crumbled, leaving a gaping hole and a pile of rubble. Weapons and shields that once hung from the walls have fallen to the floor and succumbed to rust. A large, wooden throne carved to resemble a dragon with unfolding wings faces three tall windows to the west. Slumped in the throne is a gaunt, armored figure with one gauntlet wrapped around the hilt of a greatsword.</blockquote><strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YjkzZjg3MTA0Zjlh ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Vladimir Horngaard</a></strong>, commander of the fallen Order of the Silver Dragon, is slumped in the throne. If the beacon of Argynvostholt (see <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YjBhMmJmNDI2NGQy ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area Q53</a>) has been lit, the corpse is lifeless, and characters can plunder it freely (see “Treasure” below).<br><br>\nIf the beacon has not been lit, the body is serving as a host for the revenant. If the characters approach it, it says, “Go away.” If they don’t leave immediately, read:<br><br><blockquote>The creature’s grip on the greatsword tightens. “If you have come to destroy me, know this: I perished defending this land from evil over four centuries ago, and because of my failure, I am forever doomed. If you destroy this body, my spirit will find a new corpse to inhabit, and I will hunt you down. You cannot free me from my damnation, nor would I wish it.<br><br>\n“If you have come to free this land from the creature that feasts on the blood of the innocent, know this: There is no monster I hate more than Strahd von Zarovich. He slew Argynvost, broke the life of the knight I loved, and destroyed the valiant order to which I devoted my life, but Strahd has already died once. He can’t be allowed to die again. Instead, he must suffer eternally in a hell of his own creation, from which he can never escape. Whatever can be done to bring him misery and unrest, I will do, but I will destroy anyone who tries to end his torment.”</blockquote><br>Vladimir fights in self-defense. He also rises from his throne and attacks if the characters fail to heed his warning and press him for help destroying <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTZiYzA5N2ViNTZi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Strahd</a>. The first time Vladimir takes damage, six <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MTIwYWVmYTUyY2Y5 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>phantom warriors</a></strong> materialize and join the fray, coming to his defense.<br><br>\nHatred so clouds Vladimir’s mind that he can’t remember that Sir Godfrey (area Q37) was his beloved in life. If Sir Godfrey helps the characters and faces Vladimir, anguished recognition shines in Vladimir’s eyes, yet only lighting the beacon can free him.<br><br><h4>Treasure</h4>\nVladimir Horngaard wields a <em>+2 greatsword</em>.<br>\n<br>Vladimir wears a platinum holy symbol of the Morninglord (worth 250 gp) around his neck, underneath his half plate armor.<br><br><h4><span style=\"color: rgb( 149 , 55 , 52 )\">Fortunes of Ravenloft</span></h4><span style=\"color: rgb( 149 , 55 , 52 )\"></span>If your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it’s in Vladimir’s possession, and he doesn’t part with it willingly unless the beacon of Argynvostholt has been lit (see <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YjBhMmJmNDI2NGQy ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area Q53</a>).<br><br><hr><br><h3>Q37. Knights of the Order</h3>The leaders of the Order of the Silver Dragon used to convene here.<br><br><blockquote>Through the dust and cobwebs, you see faded war banners adorning the walls of a spacious chamber, in the center of which stands a heavy wooden table. An iron chandelier hangs above the table, which is surrounded by six high-backed chairs with wood-carved dragons perched atop them. Slumped in five of the chairs are skeletal humans in tattered chainmail.</blockquote><br>If the beacon in <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YjBhMmJmNDI2NGQy ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area Q53</a> has been lit, the spirits of these revenants are laid to rest, leaving behind their inanimate corpses. If the beacon has not been lit, add the following:<br><br><blockquote>The corpses tilt their heads in your direction. One of them growls, “Why do you the living disturb the dead?”</blockquote><br>The skeletal figures are five <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YjFkODEyZDQyYjAx ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>revenants with longswords</a></strong><i style=\"font-weight: bold\">. </i>One of the revenants is <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OGI3NzRjODI4ZmVl  style=\"font-weight: bold\"><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Sir Godfrey Gwilym</a><i style=\"font-weight: bold\">. </i>All five are lawful evil. They are awaiting orders from Vladimir (area Q36) and fight only in self-defense. The revenants wear broken chainmail that affords as much protection as leather armor, and they wield longswords.<br><br><h4>Development</h4>Sir Godfrey can sense that the spirit of Argynvost isn’t at rest and isn’t happy that the order has been reduced to such a state. If the characters petition the revenants for aid, Sir Godfrey (speaking in a scratchy voice) relates all the information presented in the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MWFkNWYyMTE0NWNj ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Intro to Chapter 7</a> and <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MjAzZTk5YjcxZTNk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>The Order of the Silver Dragon</a> handouts. Neither he nor the other revenants can help the characters in any meaningful way, however, because of the oaths they have sworn to <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YjkzZjg3MTA0Zjlh ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Vladimir Horngaard</a>.<br><br><h4><span style=\"color: rgb( 99 , 36 , 35 )\">Fortunes of Ravenloft</span></h4>Godfrey is Strahd’s enemy and the characters persuasively ask him for help, he offers to join the fight against the vampire. Fate has unlocked his memory of the love that he and Vladimir once shared, and the power of that memory drives Godfrey to help fight Strahd and restore the order’s honor.<br><br>\nIf the beacon in <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YjBhMmJmNDI2NGQy ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area Q53</a> has not been lit, Godfrey’s decision incurs the wrath of the other revenants, triggering an armed conflict.<br><br>\nIf the beacon in <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YjBhMmJmNDI2NGQy ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area Q53</a> has been lit, Sir Godfrey remains a revenant even after all the other revenants (including Vladimir) are laid to rest, except that his alignment changes to lawful good. Although Sir Godfrey is unaware of the tarokka card reading, he somehow senses that he must perform one final task before his spirit can rest with Vladimir’s, and thus he agrees to help the characters face Strahd in Castle Ravenloft.<br><br><hr><br><h3>Q38. Closet</h3><blockquote>This dusty closet has a slender window set into the north wall. The room is otherwise empty.</blockquote><br><hr><br><h3>Q39. Vladimir's Bedroom</h3><blockquote>Light enters this circular room through five cracked windows. The light falls on a large, dust-covered bed in the center of the room, its posts topped with wood-carved dragons. Two large animals flank the double doors. One is a brown bear standing on its hind legs, its claws outstretched. The other is a dire wolf, its face frozen in an evil snarl. Near the wolf lies an empty wooden chest.</blockquote><br>The room once served as a bedchamber for Sir <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YjkzZjg3MTA0Zjlh ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Vladimir Horngaard</a> and <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OGI3NzRjODI4ZmVl ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Sir Godfrey Gwilym</a>. The bear and the dire wold are stuffed and harmless. Looters ransacked the chest long ago, leaving behind nothing of value.<br><br><hr><br><h3>Q40. Argynvost's Study</h3><blockquote>This room is a haven for dust and cobwebs. Three narrow windows allow slivers of light to illuminate bare oak shelves along the walls and a torn, padded chair lying on its side near a cavernous hearth. A picture above the mantel has been slashed, its lower half hanging down below the frame like a torn piece of flesh. An iron door set in the south corner of the west wall hangs open on one hinge.</blockquote><br>Strahd’s soldiers forced open the iron door that once sealed Argynvost’s vault (area Q41). They also took every book in this study but one. (Many of the books taken from here can be found in Strahd’s study in Castle Ravenloft.)<br><br>\nThe sole remaining volume lies on the floor behind the overturned chair. Titled <em>The Oath Celestial</em>, the book has been partially burned, and its cover was slashed by a sword. Leafing through the crumbling book reveals that it is a devotional text for knights from a place called the Holy Empire of Valentia. Most of the knights who joined Argynvost against Strahd came from that empire—now lost beyond the mists.<br><br><h4>Journal Page</h4>As the characters cross the room, read: <br><br><blockquote>You hear the soft flapping sound of wings, but can’t discern its origin.

Return my skull to its rightful crypt, and my spirit will shine here forever, bringing hope to this dark land.” With that, the dragon’s apparition fades away.</blockquote><br>The spectral dragon isn’t the spirit of Argynvost, but a spell-like effect.

Emptied chests and shattered vases lie strewn upon the floor, their contents plundered.</blockquote><br>This vault once held a dragon’s trove but was stripped of all valuables long ago.<br><br><hr><br><h3>Q42. Argynvost's Bedroom</h3><blockquote>Rich drapes, faded by time and neglect, hide the windows of this otherwise empty room.</blockquote><br>Argynvost preferred to sleep in his dragon form.

The hole is covered by a large cloth anchored on the pit’s edge and camouflaged with dirt and debris.<br><br>The DC to spot the pit is 10. Anyone stepping on the cloth falls through and pulls the cloth down into the pit, taking damage based on the pit’s depth (usually 10 feet, but some pits are deeper).<br><br><strong><em>Hidden Pit.</em></strong> This pit has a cover constructed from material identical to the floor around it.<br><br>A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check discerns an absence of foot traffic over the section of floor that forms the pit’s cover. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check is necessary to confirm that the trapped section of floor is actually the cover of a pit.<br><br>When a creature steps on the cover, it swings open like a trapdoor, causing the intruder to spill into the pit below. The pit is usually 10 or 20 feet deep but can be deeper.<br><br>Once the pit trap is detected, an iron spike or similar object can be wedged between the pit’s cover and the surrounding floor in such a way as to prevent the cover from opening, thereby making it safe to cross. The cover can also be magically held shut using the <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=ODJiZjI0Y2ZjN2Vk ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>arcane lock</a></em> spell or similar magic.<br><br><strong><em>Locking Pit.</em></strong> This pit trap is identical to a hidden pit trap, with one key exception: the trap door that covers the pit is spring-loaded.

The cover can also be smashed open (determine the cover’s statistics using the guidelines in chapter 8). A character in the pit can also attempt to disable the spring mechanism from the inside with a DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools, provided that the mechanism can be reached and the character can see. In some cases, a mechanism (usually hidden behind a secret door nearby) opens the pit.<br><br><strong><em>Spiked Pit.</em></strong> This pit trap is a simple, hidden, or locking pit trap with sharpened wooden or iron spikes at the bottom. A creature falling into the pit takes 11 (2d10) piercing damage from the spikes, in addition to any falling damage. Even nastier versions have poison smeared on the spikes. In that case, anyone taking piercing damage from the spikes must also make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking an 22 (4d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.<br></section>","img":""}

The <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NGVhMzI0YTQ0ZWJj ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i><strong>armored saber-toothed tiger</strong></a> locked inside becomes enraged and smashes through the wagon door. The characters and everyone else in town hear the screams of the young men as the tiger escapes. The tiger flees the stockyard without harming the Wachters and begins to prowl the streets, looking for an escape. Reports of a tiger running loose in the streets ruin the festival and send townsfolk scurrying for their homes.<br><br>\nThe saber-toothed tiger doesn’t harm anyone until it takes damage, whereupon it attacks the perceived source of the damage. If he is still alive, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OWI0OGEwMDg5M2Qy ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Izek Strazni</a> gathers six town guards and hunts down the beast with the intention of killing it. Meanwhile, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MTY5MmZlODgzNzJi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Rictavio</a> does his best to lure the beast back to his wagon while assuring townsfolk that it won’t harm them.<br><br><h4>Development</h4>If he’s still in power, the burgomaster conducts an investigation to find out where the tiger came from. Guards and local witnesses are questioned. The Wachter boys feign innocence, insisting that they were at the festival, but Gunther and Yelena Arasek (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YWIzMjIyNzE0OGFk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area N5</a>) admit to hearing “evil growls” and scratching sounds coming from inside the carnival wagon parked in their stockyard. When pressed, the Araseks admit to seeing the wagon’s “weird owner” routinely drop food into the wagon through a hatch in the roof. They also confess that the half-elf paid them for their silence.<br><br>\nAfter the burgomaster learns that the tiger belongs to Rictavio, he commands his guards to arrest the mysterious bard. If Rictavio thinks the characters can help him, he asks them to distract the burgomaster and the guards while he gathers his horse, wagon, and tiger (in that order). If the characters ask Rictavio where he plans to go, he tells them about an old tower to the west where he can lie low (see chapter 11, “<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YzI4NTRlMTIxMTFk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Van Rich­ten’s Tower</a>”).<br><br><hr><br><h3>Lady Wachter's Wish</h3>Ernst Larnak (see <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=OWQxOGFlMDU1YWRm ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area N4</a>) begins shadowing the characters. Characters who have a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 14 or higher notice him doing so. If they confront him, he claims that he keeps a watchful eye on all strangers, though he doesn’t mention the name of his employer. If the characters threaten him, he backs off and reports to Lady Wachter after he believes he’s not being watched or pursued.<br><br>\nLady Wachter is looking for powerful allies to help her oust the burgomaster. If Ernst tells her that he thinks the characters fit the bill, Lady Wachter has Ernst or her sons invite the characters to a private dinner at <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=OWQxOGFlMDU1YWRm ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Wachterhaus</a>. During the dinner, Lady Wachter determines whether the characters have the ability and the resolve to crush the baron.<br><br>\nIf the characters refuse her invitation, or if they profess to be enemies of Strahd, Lady Wachter marks them as her enemies and sets out to destroy them without incriminating herself.<br><br><h4>Development</h4>Once she determines that the characters are her enemies, Lady Wachter hands Ernst a bag of 100 gp (taken from <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=OWQxOGFlMDU1YWRm ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area N4q</a>) and instructs him to deliver it to the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NzAzZjc4MGFjNWZk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Vistani</a> camp outside town (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ODllODk5YTg3YTEx ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area N9</a>), along with a letter from her that asks the Vistani to dispose of the characters once they have left town. The Vistani burn the letter after reading it, as per Lady Wachter’s request.<br><br>If the characters have rescued <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=M2FlYmU3MWJiYzdl ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Arabelle</a> (see <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NDFhNjJjZDAyMGU3 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Areas of Barovia</a>, chapter 2, area L) the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NzAzZjc4MGFjNWZk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Vistani</a> return Lady Wachter’s gold to Ernst and do nothing.<br><br>\nOtherwise, a <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OGYwMTAyODRiNTg3 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Vistana bandit</a> watches the road east of Vallaki and reports back to camp if the characters are sighted leaving. The Vistani, worried that the characters might be more than a match for them, send one emissary on horseback to race ahead of the characters and inform Strahd. If <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OTExMDZkOWQ1MzRh ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Arrigal</a> is alive, he makes the ride himself. Otherwise, the rider is a young Vistana bandit named Alexei (see <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ODllODk5YTg3YTEx ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area N9c</a>).<br><hr><br><h3>St. Andral's Feast</h3>The characters can prevent this special event from occurring by returning the bones of St. Andral to the church (area N1, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YWIzMjIyNzE0OGFk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Areas of Vallaki</a>) or by destroying the vampire spawn hiding in the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MWQ3Zjc2OTNmNmYx ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>coffin maker’s shop</a> (area N6). If the characters stay in Vallaki for three days or more and don’t retrieve the bones or destroy the vampire spawn, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTZiYzA5N2ViNTZi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Strahd</a> visits the coffin maker’s shop the following evening and orchestrates an attack on the church.<br><br>\nThe vampire spawn begin the attack that night. They cling to the outer walls and roof of St. Andral’s church while four <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NjVhZTI3NTMzNjMz ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>swarms of bats</a></strong> enter the church through the belfry and terrify the congregation. As the townsfolk flee the church, the vampire spawn leap down and attack them.<br><br>\nDuring the chaos, Strahd enters the church in bat form, then reverts to vampire form and attacks Father Lucian. Unless the characters intervene, Strahd kills the priest before returning to Castle Ravenloft.<br><br>\nIf Father Lucian dies, locals bury his body in the church cemetery, whereupon it rises the following night as a <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YWM4NmJjYmJiMGE1 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>vampire spawn</a></strong> under Strahd’s control.

After a few days, fear turns to misdirected rage as townsfolk blame the burgomaster. Baron Vallakovich’s “All will be well!” mantra can’t protect him from their wrath. Barring intervention by the characters, the burgomaster’s mansion is set ablaze, and the baron, his wife, and his son are dragged to the town square, thrown in the stocks, and stoned to death. If he is alive, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OWI0OGEwMDg5M2Qy ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Izek Strazni</a> flees the town to avoid a similar fate.

Blue Water Inn</h2>\n<blockquote>Gray smoke issues from the chimney of this large, two-story wooden building with a stone foundation and sagging tile roof, upon which several ravens have perched. A painted wooden sign hanging above the main entrance depicts a blue waterfall.</blockquote>\n<br />Picture: <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"MTNjMDQ1MDIwMWZm\">Handout: Martikov Family</a><br /><br />The Blue Water Inn is Vallaki&rsquo;s main gathering place for locals, especially at night. The innkeeper, Urwin Martikov, considers the inn a sanctuary from the evils of this land. In the event of trouble, the windows and doors can all be barred shut from within.<br /><br />A bed for the night costs 1 ep. Characters looking for something to eat are fed hot beet soup and fresh bread at no additional charge. A cooked wolf steak costs 1 ep.<br /><br />The inn offers a pint of Purple Grapemash No. 3 wine for 3 cp, or a pint of the superior Red Dragon Crush wine for 1 sp. Urwin is hurt if the characters complain about the wines, for his family makes them.<br /><br />The inn&rsquo;s wine supply is almost depleted, and the latest delivery from the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"ZTRkYjc1NzhiYjcz\">Wizard of Wines Winery</a> is overdue. If the characters claim to be adventurers, Urwin asks them if they would be so kind as to find out what&rsquo;s holding up the latest shipment, promising them free room and board if they return with the wine.<br /><br />\n<h4>Keepers of the Feather</h4>\nUrwin Martikov (LG male human) is a <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"NzBhNmIwNTcxN2Y0\">wereraven</a></strong> and a high-ranking member of the Keepers of the Feather, a secret society of wereravens that opposes Strahd. Urwin&rsquo;s wife and business partner, Danika Dorakova (LG female human), is also a&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><a class=\"entity-link\" style=\"text-shadow: red 0px 0px 8px;\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"NzBhNmIwNTcxN2Y0\">wereraven</a></strong> , as are their two sons, Brom and Bray. The boys have only 7 hit points each and, at ages eleven and nine, are too young to be effective combatants.<br /><br />At any given time, another 1d4 <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"NzBhNmIwNTcxN2Y0\">wereravens</a></strong> (members of the Keepers of the Feather) are present at the inn, either perched on the rooftop in raven form or huddled inside in human form. These wereravens are loyal friends of the Martikovs and help protect the inn.<br /><br />If the characters earn the trust of the wereravens in Vallaki, the Keepers of the Feather will watch their backs. The next time the characters get themselves in serious trouble, you can have a group of 1d4&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><a class=\"entity-link\" style=\"text-shadow: red 0px 0px 8px;\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"NzBhNmIwNTcxN2Y0\">wereraven</a></strong> show up to rescue or otherwise help them.<br /><br />\n<h4><span style=\"color: #632423;\">Fortunes of Ravenloft</span></h4>\nIf your card reading reveals that a treasure is hidden at the inn, the Keepers of the Feather don&rsquo;t reveal where the treasure is until they know the characters are capable of protecting it. As a way of testing their abilities, Urwin gives the characters the following quest:<br /><br />\n<blockquote>Urwin takes you aside and keeps his voice low. &ldquo;My supply of wine is nearly gone, and the next shipment is overdue. I&rsquo;ll give you what you seek if you bring me my wine. The vineyard and winery is a few miles west of here. Just follow the Old Svalich Road and the signs.&rdquo;</blockquote>\n<br />Urwin fails to mention that his cantankerous father, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"Mzg3YWU3MzQ3MjRm\">Davian Martikov</a>, owns the local winery and vineyard, the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"ZTRkYjc1NzhiYjcz\">Wizard of Wines</a> (chapter 12). There&rsquo;s bad blood between Urwin and his father (whom Urwin and Danika refer to as &ldquo;the old crow&rdquo;). Although Urwin could easily visit the winery himself, he considers dealing with his father to be a worthy test of the characters&rsquo; competence, and he makes good on his promise if they complete the quest and return with his wine shipment.<br /><br />Urwin sends a <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"NzBhNmIwNTcxN2Y0\">wereraven</a></strong> in raven form to observe the party&rsquo;s progress from a distance. If the characters get in trouble, the wereraven reports to Urwin at once.<br /><br /><hr /><br />\n<h3>N2a. Well</h3>\nA 3-foot-high stone rim surrounds the mouth of this 40-foot-deep, moss-lined well. The inn draws fresh water from this well.<br /><br /><hr /><br />\n<h3>N2b. Outside Staircase</h3>\nA wooden staircase hugs the outer wall of the inn and leads up to guest quarters on the upper floor (areas N2l and N2m). The sturdy wooden door at the top of the stairs can be barred from the inside.<br /><br /><hr /><br />\n<h3>N2c. Taproom</h3>\n<blockquote>Damp cloaks hang from pegs in the entrance portico. The tavern is packed with tables and chairs, with narrow paths meandering between them. A bar stretches along one wall, under a balcony that can be reached by a wooden staircase that hugs the north wall. Another balcony overhangs an entrance to the east. All the windows are fitted with thick shutters and crossbars. Lanterns hanging above the bar and resting on the tables bathe the room in dull orange light and cast shadows upon the walls, most of which are adorned with wolf heads mounted on wooden plaques.</blockquote>\n<br />The double doors leading into the taproom can be barred shut from within.<br /><br />Mounted on braces and tucked into alcoves behind the bar are three wine barrels, each one three-quarters empty. Two of the barrels contain Purple Grapemash No. 3 (a cheap wine), and the third contains Red Dragon Crush (a fine wine). A brass spigot is hammered into each barrel.<br /><br />Danika Martikov usually tends bar while her husband busies himself in the kitchen (area N2e). Their boys, Brom and Bray, scamper about and easily get underfoot.<br /><br />Between dawn and noon, there are no patrons here, and the Martikovs are upstairs in their bedrooms (areas N2o and N2p) or in the attic (area N2q).<br />From noon to dusk, the taproom holds 2d4 local patrons (LG male and female <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"OWYxMjNkNjFkMTdj\">commoners</a></strong>). Between dusk and midnight, 2d8 Vallakians are here. In addition, one or more of the following people might be present during this time.<br /><br /><strong><em>Wolf Hunters. </em></strong><strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"ZDVkMTQwY2YyYzkx\">Szoldar Szoldarovich</a></strong> and <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"MDU0MGE2YTY3NmZk\">Yevgeni Krushkin</a></strong> (N male human) are local hunters who frequent the Blue Water Inn. They kill wolves and sell the meat for a living, and their work is dangerous and bloody. Both men are grim and have haunted looks in their eyes.<br /><br />These two are dour fellows, but they seldom pass up an opportunity to earn coin. If the characters are looking for guides or information about the land of Barovia, Szoldar and Yevgeni can be of service. They aren&rsquo;t afraid to venture beyond Vallaki&rsquo;s walls during the day, and they know the woods and valley well. They&rsquo;re willing to serve as guides for 5 gp per day, or to provide directions to important landmarks in exchange for free drinks. They think it&rsquo;s foolish to travel &ldquo;this cursed realm&rdquo; at night and won&rsquo;t do so unless their payment is exorbitant (100 gp or more).<br /><br />On rare occasions when he has something to say, Szoldar speaks brusquely, while Yevgeni usually parrots his friend in not so many words. Szoldar has a notch in his bow for every wolf he&rsquo;s killed, while Yevgeni adds a new swatch to his wolfskin cloak every time he makes a kill. Both men have families but spend most of their time together, either drowning their sorrows or hunting in the woods. Most of the wolf heads that adorn the tavern walls are the result of their handiwork.<br /><br /><strong><em>Wachter Brothers.</em></strong> Nikolai Wachter and Karl Wachter (N male human<strong> <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"NTQ0NTQyYjBjN2Vl\">nobles</a></strong>) are brothers of noble birth. They are brash drunkards always looking for trouble, though they are smart enough not to pick fights with well-armed strangers. Their mother, Fiona Wachter (see area N4), is an influential figure in town, but her sons never talk about her. They&rsquo;d rather listen to tales of the characters&rsquo; harrowing adventures or hear about how the characters plan to free Vallaki from the burgomaster&rsquo;s madness.<br /><br /><strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"MTY5MmZlODgzNzJi\">Rictavio</a></strong><strong><em>. </em></strong>The lone guest of the Blue Water Inn at present is a colorfully dressed half-elf bard who goes by the name <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"MTY5MmZlODgzNzJi\">Rictavio</a></strong>&mdash;a false identity adopted by the legendary vampire hunter Rudolph van Richten. He regales tavern patrons with stories so outrageous as to be hardly believable, yet he asserts they are true indeed. Rictavio claims to be a carnival ringmaster from a distant land. He&rsquo;s been staying at the inn for almost a month, taking advantage of Urwin Martikov&rsquo;s generosity and good nature. When he arrived, he was accompanied by a monkey named <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"YzU3ZmVhZmU5ZDIx\">Piccolo</a>. The monkey wasn&rsquo;t welcome at the inn, so Rictavio gave it to the local toymaker (see <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"YWIzMjIyNzE0OGFk\">area N7</a>).<br /><br />Rictavio admits to having no musical talent but manages to entertain locals nonetheless with his stories of faraway places. Twice each day, at dawn and again at dusk, he leaves the inn with a couple of apples and a cooked wolf steak wrapped in a handkerchief. He claims the food is for his portly friend, &ldquo;the destitute toymaker&rdquo; (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"YWIzMjIyNzE0OGFk\">area N7</a>) and his pet monkey. In fact, the apples are for his horse Drusilla (area N2f), and the steak is for his captured saber-toothed tiger (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"YWIzMjIyNzE0OGFk\">area N5</a>).<br /><br />During his stay at the inn, Rictavio is quietly gathering information on the Keepers of the Feather, trying to figure out the identities of all the wereravens in town. He&rsquo;s also trying to learn as much as he can about the Vistani, particularly the ones living in the camp just outside town (area N9). Once he concludes that they are in league with <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"ZTZiYzA5N2ViNTZi\">Strahd</a>, Rictavio plans to unleash his trained saber-toothed tiger upon them, with or without the support of the wereravens.<br /><br />Rictavio wears a <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"YTFlZmE0M2M3ZTZi\">hat of disguise</a></em> and a <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"OGQ0MTc4YzM3YmVj\">ring of mind shielding</a></em> to conceal his identity. He carries an iron key that unlocks the door to his carnival wagon (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"YWIzMjIyNzE0OGFk\">Area N5</a>).<br /><br /><hr /><br />\n<h3>N2d. Wine Storage</h3>\n<blockquote>This hallway contains three curtained alcoves as well as a larger area stuffed with wine barrels.</blockquote>\n<br />The Martikovs store their wine here. Tucked behind red curtains are three alcoves, each one containing a half-emptied wine barrel lying on its side in a wooden brace. Twelve empty wine barrels are piled two high near the door to the kitchen (area N2e). All the barrels have the Wizard of Wines name burned into them.<br /><br />Nine of the fifteen barrels, including two of the barrels in the curtained alcoves, have the following label burned into their sides, under the winery&rsquo;s name: Purple Grapemash No. 3. Six of the fifteen barrels, including one of the barrels in the curtained alcoves, have a different label: Red Dragon Crush.<br /><br />The double doors that lead outside can be barred shut from within.<br /><br /><hr /><br />\n<h3>N2e. Kitchen</h3>\n<blockquote>This room looks like the kitchen of someone who loves to cook. It has piles of pots, walls lined with utensils and shelves of ingredients, and all manner of pleasant odors. Two lanterns hang above a sturdy pine worktable in the middle of the clutter. A pot of soup bubbles on the hearth.</blockquote>\n<br />Urwin Martikov, who prepares most of the meals, is found here throughout the day. He occasionally receives help from his two boys, but they are easily distracted. A cupboard against the east wall holds most of the inn&rsquo;s supply of cutlery and dishware, none of it valuable. A door in the west wall leads outside and is usually barred from the inside.<br /><br />A secret door at the west end of the south wall can be pushed open to reveal a wooden staircase that leads up to area N2i.<br /><br /><hr /><br />\n<h3>N2f. Stable</h3>\nThe sliding wooden doors on the west wall of this room are held shut by an iron lock and chain. Urwin carries the key to the lock. The doors to the north and south can be barred shut from the inside but are usually unlocked.<br /><br />\n<blockquote>You hear the squawking of birds and the plaintive whinny of a horse as you peer inside this stable. The stalls are clean and well maintained. One of them contains a gray mare. A small door is set into the east wall, and a wooden ladder gives access to a loft overhead. Perched on the wooden railing that encloses the loft are dozens of ravens.</blockquote>\n<br />Any character who has a horse can keep it here for 1 sp per night. The gray mare is a <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"NDVmYmY0YWQ5OTgx\">draft horse</a></strong> named Drusilla, and she likes apples. The horse belongs to <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"MTY5MmZlODgzNzJi\">Rictavio</a> (see area N2c).<br /><br />The small door in the east wall can be pulled open to reveal area N2g. The loft is described in area N2h.<br /><br /><hr /><br />\n<h3>N2g. Storage</h3>\nThis small room lies under a wooden staircase (area N2i). Hanging from wooden pegs are saddles and barding to equip two horses. In an unlocked wooden chest are a dozen horseshoes, a wooden mallet, and a mound of horseshoe nails.<br /><br /><hr /><br />\n<h3>N2h. Ravens' Loft</h3>\nDim light spilling in through a pair of dirt-encrusted windows reveals piles of hay with pitchforks sticking out of them. Ravens rule this roost&mdash;you can see hundreds of them.<br /><br />Characters who search the loft thoroughly find three pitchforks and a locked wooden chest buried under a pile of hay (see &ldquo;Treasure&rdquo; below), next to a secret door. If the characters tamper with the chest, the ravens gather into four <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"OGU4ZWY1YzMyYTNj\">swarms of ravens</a></strong> and attack. If two swarms are killed, the others flee. Otherwise, they cease their attacks if the characters leave the chest alone. If the fighting continues for more than 3 rounds, Urwin Martikov and two other <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"NzBhNmIwNTcxN2Y0\">wereravens</a> hear the ruckus and investigate (in human form).<br /><br />A secret door in the back of the loft can be pushed open to reveal a bedchamber (area N2p) beyond. No ability check is required to spot the secret door, because light in the room beyond slips through the door&rsquo;s cracks.<br /><br /><strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> Inside the locked chest are 140 ep, 70 pp, two<em> <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"NjRkMzAzODZjNzE5\">elixirs of health</a></em>, three<em> <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"NDBhYzNmNWNmZDNl\">potions of healing</a></em>, and a gray <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"YzVkMmU3YjI1NTdm\">bag of tricks</a></em>. The coins are embossed with the profiled likeness of Strahd von Zarovich.<br /><br /><hr /><br />\n<h3>N2i. Secret Stairs and Hall</h3>\n<blockquote>A wooden staircase to the north descends fifteen feet to a landing. A window dimly illuminates a short, wood-panelled hallway that runs west to east.</blockquote>\n<br />Guests aren't told about the inn's secret hallway. <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"MTY5MmZlODgzNzJi\">Rictavio</a> knows of its existence because he has heard the Martikov boys opening and closing the secret door closest to his room (area N2n).<br /><br />At each end of this area is a secret door, each of which is easy to spot from inside the hallway (no ability check required). The northern secret door, at the bottom of the staircase, can be pulled open to reveal the kitchen (area N2e) beyond. The eastern secret door can be pulled open to reveal a balcony (area N2j) that overlooks the taproom.<br /><br /><hr /><br />\n<h3>N2j. Great Balcony</h3>\n<blockquote>A wooden balcony stretches the full length of the taproom, enclosed by a wooden railing carved with raven motifs. The taproom&rsquo;s many lanterns illuminate the rafters and cast ominous shadows on the peaked ceiling.</blockquote>\n<br />The balcony floor is 15 feet above the taproom floor.<br /><br />A secret door at the south end of the western wall can be pushed open to reveal a wood-paneled hallway (area N2i) beyond.<br /><br /><hr /><br />\n<h3>N2k. Guest Balcony</h3>\n<blockquote>This twenty-foot-long balcony provides a clear view of the bar and has a wooden railing carved with raven motifs. The taproom&rsquo;s many lanterns illuminate the rafters and cast ominous shadows on the peaked ceiling.</blockquote>\n<br />The balcony floor is 15 feet above the taproom floor.<br /><br /><hr /><br />\n<h3>N2l. Guest Rooms</h3>\nThese two rooms have identical furnishings.<br /><br />\n<blockquote>Two cozy beds with matching footlockers rest in the far corners of this fifteen-foot-square room. Wolf furs are heaped atop each bed. Between the beds, a lamp sits on a table under a shuttered window. Two tall black wardrobes stand against the wall by the door.</blockquote>\n<br />The door to this room can be locked from the inside, and each guest gets a key. Urwin and Danika carry spare keys. The footlockers and wardrobes are empty and are for the use of guests.<br /><br /><hr /><br />\n<h3>N2m. Guest Room</h3>\n<blockquote>Four plain beds with straw mattresses line the north wall of this well-lit room. Each bed comes with a matching footlocker to store clothing and other belongings. A table and four chairs occupy the corner across from the door. An oil lamp resting on the table casts a bright yellow flame.</blockquote>\n<br />The door to this room can be locked from the inside, and each guest receives a key. Urwin and Danika carry spare keys. The footlockers are empty and are for the use of guests.<br /><br /><hr /><br />\n<h3>N2n. Private Guest Room</h3>\n<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"MTY5MmZlODgzNzJi\">Rictavio</a> has a key to this room, which is locked at all times. Urwin and Danika carry spare keys. The door&rsquo;s lock can be picked, but discretion is called for because the door is in plain view of the taproom below.<br /><br />\n<blockquote>This small guest room contains a bed heaped with wolf furs, a footlocker, a tall wardrobe, and a writing desk with matching chair. An oil lamp rests atop the desk near a journal bound in a red leather jacket.</blockquote>\n<br />Rictavio sleeps here between midnight and dawn. At dawn, he leaves to check on his horse (area N2f) and his wagon (area N5), returning to the inn around noon. Between noon and dusk, there&rsquo;s a 40 percent chance he is here; otherwise, he&rsquo;s in the taproom (area N2c). At dusk, he leaves the inn to tend to his horse and his wagon again, then returns to his room to retire for the night.<br /><br />Rictavio is too clever to leave anything valuable or incriminating in his room. The footlocker and the wardrobe contain nothing but common clothes and travel wear.<br /><br /><strong><em>Rictavio&rsquo;s Journal.</em></strong> The journal on the desk is a bit of artifice that Rictavio created to perpetuate the illusion that he is an entertainer in search of new acts for his traveling carnival. His writing makes frequent mention of conversations with Drusilla (which the journal fails to mention is the name of Rictavio&rsquo;s horse) and recounts many long and tedious journeys by wagon. Rictavio has also written about various &ldquo;oddities&rdquo; he has seen in his travels, including the following:<br /><br />\n<ul>\n<li>A &ldquo;werehare&rdquo; child (a boy who transforms into a rabbit on nights of the full moon)</li>\n<li>A half-orc woman named Gorabacha who could chew through iron chains</li>\n<li>A giant, man-eating plant that had the most remarkable singing voice</li>\n<li>A pair of conjoined goblins</li>\n<li>A small man with no legs named Filmore Stunk, who could drink whole casks of wine without getting drunk</li>\n</ul>\n<br /><hr /><br />\n<h3>N2o. Boys' Bedroom</h3>\n<blockquote>A large, painted toy box rests between two small, cozy beds. Murals of ravens in flight are painted on the walls above the wood paneling.</blockquote>\n<br />Brom and Bray Martikova don&rsquo;t spend much time in this room. The toy box contains a pile of neglected toys, many of them etched with the slogan &ldquo;Is No Fun, Is No Blinsky!&rdquo; The toys include the following:<br /><br />\n<ul>\n<li>A miniature puppet theater with appropriately sized marionettes of a king, a queen, a prince, a princess, an executioner, a tax collector, a dunce, a vampire, and a vampire hunter</li>\n<li>A garish toy Vistani wagon hitched to a wooden horse and filled with tiny wooden Vistani figures</li>\n<li>A pair of painted wooden clown masks, one displaying a mean scowl and the other a frightened expression</li>\n<li>A wooden top painted with images of scarecrows chasing children through the forest</li>\n<li>A stuffed (real) bat on puppet strings</li>\n</ul>\n<br />A hidden trapdoor in the 8-foot-high ceiling opens into a secret attic (area N2q).<br /><br /><hr /><br />\n<h3>N2p. Master Bedroom</h3>\n<blockquote>Matching end tables flank a large wood-framed bed with a red silk canopy. Across from the bed hangs a tapestry depicting a beautiful mountain valley. The other walls are dominated by a fireplace and a wardrobe.</blockquote>\n<br />Urwin and Danika retire to this room every night before heading to the attic (area N2q) to sleep. This room is for appearances only and contains no valuables.<br />A secret door at the west end of the south wall can be pulled open to reveal the loft beyond (area N2h).<br /><br />A hidden trapdoor in the 8-foot-high ceiling opens into a secret attic (area N2q).<br /><br /><hr /><br />\n<h3>N2q. Secret Attic</h3>\n<blockquote>This ten-foot-wide, thirty-five-foot-long attic has a ceiling that slants down toward the west, dropping from a height of eight feet to a height of five feet. Four straw nests cover the floor, and a locked iron strongbox sits against the north wall. A small square opening in the south wall leads outside. Two trapdoors with iron hinges are set into the floor.</blockquote>\n<br />The Martikovs sleep here at night in hybrid form. The opening in the south wall is just big enough for a raven or other Tiny creature to pass through. The <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"NzBhNmIwNTcxN2Y0\">wereravens</a> can use this opening as an escape route.<br /><br />The strongbox is described in &ldquo;Treasure&rdquo; below.<br /><br />Two trapdoors, clearly visible on the floor, can be pulled open to reveal the bedchambers (areas N2o and N2p) that lie directly beneath them.<br /><br /><strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> Urwin carries the key to the locked iron strongbox. The lock can be picked with thieves&rsquo; tools and a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. The box contains a sack of 150 ep (each coin bearing the profiled visage of Strahd<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"ZTZiYzA5N2ViNTZi\"> von Zarovich</a>), six pieces of jewelry (worth 250 gp each), and three<em> <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"NDBhYzNmNWNmZDNl\">potions of healing</a></em>.<br /><br />\n<h4><span style=\"color: #632423;\">Fortunes of Ravenloft</span></h4>\nIf your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it is in the iron strongbox.</section>","img":"modules/cor-cos/journal/005_-_Chapter_5_3A_The_Town_of_Vallaki/005_-_Blue_Water_Inn/avatar.webp"}

That I have survived countless supernatural assaults is seen as a marvel among my peers; my name is spoken with fear and loathing among my foes.<br><br>In truth, this “virtuous” calling began as an obsessive effort to destroy a vampire that murdered my child, and it has become for me a tedious and bleak career. Even as my life of hunting monsters began, I felt the weight of time on my weary shoulders. Today I am a man who has simply lived too long. Like a regretful lich, I find myself inexorably bound to an existence I sought out of madness and, seemingly, must now endure for all eternity. Of course I shall die, but whether I shall ever rest in my grave haunts my idle thoughts, and torments me in my dreams.<br><br>I expect that those who think me a hero will change their minds when they know the whole truth about my life as a hunter of the unnatural. Nevertheless, I must reveal, here and now, that I have been the indirect yet certain cause of many deaths, and the loss of many good friends. Mistake me not! I do not merely feel sorry for myself. Rather, I come to grips with a devastating realization: I now see that I am the object of a baleful <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NzAzZjc4MGFjNWZk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Vistani</a> curse. More tragically, the nature of this hex is such that I have not borne the brunt of it; instead, far worse, those who surround me have fallen victim to it!<br><br>I have related the tragic story of how my only child Erasmus was taken by <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NzAzZjc4MGFjNWZk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Vistani</a> and sold to a vampire. I explained how Erasmus was made a minion of the night stalker, and how it was my miserable part to free him from that fate at the point of a stake. What I have neglected to illuminate before is how I tracked Erasmus’s kidnappers across the land, or how I “extracted” Erasmus’s whereabouts from them.<br><br>In fact, the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NzAzZjc4MGFjNWZk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Vistani</a> took Erasmus with my own, unwitting permission. They had brought an extremely ill member of their tribe to me one evening and insisted that I treat him, but I was unable to save the young man’s life. In fear of their retribution, I begged the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NzAzZjc4MGFjNWZk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Vistani</a> to take anything of mine if only they would withhold their terrifying powers, of which I knew nothing. To my lasting astonishment, they chose to surreptitiously take my son in exchange for their loss! By the time I realized what had occurred, they were already an hour gone.<br><br>Incensed beyond reason, I strapped the body of the dead young man to my horse and doggedly followed the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NzAzZjc4MGFjNWZk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Vistani</a> caravan through the woods, naively allowing the sun to set before me without seeking shelter from the night. Shortly after darkness fell, I was beset by undead that would have slain me, had not their master—a lich—intervened and spared my life, for reasons that I do not completely understand. He somehow detected me and, with his powerful magic, took control of a pack of <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=M2JhZmNmMzE0MDdj ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>zombies</a> that wandered in the forest. He spoke to me through the mouths of the dead things and placed a magic ward against undead on me, then animated the dead Vistana and bade it tell me where I could find its people. Unfortunately (I say in hindsight), the plan worked. I found the child-stealers, and my unwelcome entourage included a growing horde of voracious undead that could not touch me, thanks to the lich’s ward.<br><br>When I found the caravan, I threatened to set the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=M2JhZmNmMzE0MDdj ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>zombies</a> on the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NzAzZjc4MGFjNWZk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Vistani</a> unless they returned my dear boy. They replied that he had been sold to the vampire, Baron Metus. Something inside me snapped. I released the zombies, and the entire tribe was eaten alive.<br><br>Yet the story has not ended. Before she died, the leader cursed me, saying, “Live you always among monsters, and see everyone you love die beneath their claws!” Even now, so many years later, I can hear her words with painful clarity. A short time later, I found my dear Erasmus made into a vampire. He begged me to end his curse, which I did with a heavy heart. The darkness had torn him from my loving arms forever, and I foolishly believed that the curse had exacted its deadly toll. I wept until an insatiate desire for vengeance filled the bottomless rift in my heart.<br>","img":"modules/cor-cos/journal/011_-_Chapter_11_3A_Van_Richten_27s_Tower/004_-_Chapter_11_3A_Handouts/001_-_Handout_3A_Journal_of_Rudolph_Van_Richten/avatar.webp"}

The road is intented to be only visible by you and is stretch all over the map.<br /><br />GM Notes :</p>\n<h2>Areas of Barovia</h2>\nThe following areas correspond to labels on the map of Barovia.<br /><br />\n<h3>A. Old Svalich Road</h3>\n<blockquote>Black pools of water stand like dark mirrors in and around the muddy roadway. Giant trees loom on both sides of the road, their branches clawing at the mist.</blockquote>\n<br />If the characters are walking along the road, they arrive at area B after 5 hours. If the characters are traveling in Vistani wagons, the travel time is halved.<br /><hr /><br />\n<h3>B. Gates of Barovia</h3>\nPicture: <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"MWU4NjMxMmQyYTdm\">Handout: Gates of Barovia</a><br /><br />Two sets of these gates exist: one west of the village of Barovia and one east of the village.<br /><br />\n<blockquote>The fog spills out of the forest to swallow up the road behind you. Ahead, jutting from the impenetrable woods on both sides of the road, are high stone buttresses looming gray in the fog. Huge iron gates hang on the stonework. Dew clings with cold tenacity to the rusted bars. Two headless statues of armed guardians flank the gate, their heads now lying among the weeds at their feet. They greet you only with silence.</blockquote>\n<br />If the characters are traveling on foot, the gates swing open as they approach, screeching as the hinges move. <br /><br />The gates close behind the characters after they pass through. If the characters are riding in Vistani wagons, the gates open in front of the lead wagon and close when the rear one has entered.<br /><br />The eastern gates don&rsquo;t open for people trying to leave Strahd&rsquo;s domain unless they are accompanied by Vistani. The fog chokes any non-Vistani that passes through the gates or skirts around them when they are closed (see &ldquo;Mists of Ravenloft&rdquo; in the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"M2Y0ZjdlMmFhN2Fj\">Lay of the Land</a> handout).<br /><br />If Strahd is defeated, the gates of Barovia swing open, and the road east becomes clear of fog.<br /><hr /><br />\n<h3>C. Svalich Woods</h3>\n<blockquote>Towering trees, whose tops are lost in heavy gray mist, block out all but a death-gray light. The tree trunks are unnaturally close to one another, and the woods have the silence of a forgotten grave, yet exude the feeling of an unvoiced scream.</blockquote>\n<br />If the characters are traveling in Vistani wagons, they can continue on to the village of Barovia (area E) without incident.<br /><br />If the characters are following the road on foot, the party member who has the highest passive Wisdom (Perception) score notices something:<br /><br />\n<blockquote>You catch the scent of death on the air.</blockquote>\n<br />The character can follow the stench to its source:<br /><br />\n<blockquote>The foul scent leads you to a human corpse half-buried in the underbrush about fifteen feet from the road. The young man appears to be a commoner. His muddy clothes are torn and raked with claw marks. Crows have been at the body, which is surrounded by the paw prints. The man has obviously been dead for several days. He holds a crumpled envelope in one hand.</blockquote>\n<br />The dead man, Dalvan Olensky, was trying to escape from Barovia with a letter from his master when he was killed on the road by Strahd&rsquo;s dire wolves. Wanting to return at once to Strahd, the wolves left the body in the woods but have not yet returned to feast.<br /><br />The letter in Dalvan&rsquo;s hand has a large &ldquo;B&rdquo; set into its wax seal. The parchment is worn and flimsy. If the characters open and read the letter, show the players <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"OWVkMDU4NDdkODA2\">Handout: Kolyan Indirovich&rsquo;s Letter (Version 2)</a>. The letter is dated one week ago.<br /><br />Dalvan was instructed to place the letter at the gates, in the hope that visitors would find it, and turn back.<br /><br />If the characters linger in the woods, they hear a lone wolf howl far off in the forest. Each round, one more wolf adds its voice to the howling, with the sound getting progressively closer to the party. If the characters are still in the woods after 5 rounds of howling, five <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"Y2U1NjM4N2M0ZDgw\">dire wolves</a></strong> arrive and attack. If the characters are trying to leave Barovia, these dire wolves are joined by a pack of twenty <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"MWM2Nzc5NjRiZTQy\">wolves</a></strong>. The wolves and the dire wolves stop their attack if the characters return to the road and head toward the village of Barovia (area E).<br /><hr /><br />\n<h3>D. River Ivlis</h3>\nWhen the characters come within sight of this river for the first time, read:<br /><br />\n<blockquote>This river flows as clear as a blue winter sky through the valley.</blockquote>\n<br />The river is roughly 50 feet wide, with a depth ranging from 5 to 10 feet. Arching stone bridges span the river at two points, one near the village of Barovia (area E) and the other near Tser Falls (area H).<br /><hr /><br />\n<h3>E. Village of Barovia</h3>\nChapter 3 describes the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"YWZmNWU5OGQ4ZmJl\">village of Barovia</a> and the gloomy folk who reside there.<br /><hr /><br />\n<h3>F. River Ivlis Crossroads</h3>\nCheck for a random encounter whenever the characters reach area F, unless they are accompanied by <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"NzAzZjc4MGFjNWZk\">Vistani</a>.<br /><br />\n<blockquote>An old wooden gallows creaks in a chill wind that blows down from the high ground to the west. A frayed length of rope dances from its beam. The well-worn road splits here, and a signpost opposite the gallows points off in three directions: BAROVIA VILLAGE to the east, TSER POOL to the northwest, and RAVENLOFT/VALLAKI to the southwest. The northwest fork slants down and disappears into the trees, while the southwest fork clings to an upward slope. Across from the gallows, a low wall, crumbling in places, partially encloses a small plot of graves shrouded in fog.</blockquote>\n<br />The northwest fork leads down to the river and area G. The road southwest leads to area H. The east road leads to an arching stone bridge and continues on to the village of Barovia (area E). If the characters are traveling with Vistani, the Vistani lead them along the northwest road to the Vistani encampment.<br /><br />The gallows stand atop a rotting platform 5 feet high, with wooden stairs leading up to it.<br /><br />Eleven graves are here with blank gravestones. The forgotten people buried here were hanged from the gallows. Characters who dig up the graves find rotted coffins containing moldy bones.<br /><br />\n<h4>The Hanged One</h4>\nAs the characters leave the area, read:<br /><br />\n<blockquote>You hear a creaking noise behind you, coming from the gallows. Where there was nothing before now hangs a lifeless, gray body. The breeze turns the hanged figure slowly, so that it can fix its dead eyes upon you.</blockquote>\n<br />One random character sees him- or herself hanging from the gallows. The other characters see an unfamiliar Barovian. The corpse looks and smells real, and it rapidly melts away into nothing if touched or moved.<br /><br />\n<h4><span style=\"color: #632423;\">Fortunes of Ravenloft</span></h4>\nIf your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it is buried in one of the graves. For each grave the characters dig up, there&rsquo;s a cumulative 10 percent chance of finding the treasure.<br /><hr /><br />\n<h3>G. Tser Pool Encampment</h3>\n<em>(The information below is also presented in the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"YWQ0Mjg0Mzk1ZTgw\">Tser Pool Encampment</a> handout for convenience. Please navigate your players to the Tser Pool Encampment Map as well.)</em><br /><br />\n<blockquote>The road gradually disappears and is replaced by a twisted, muddy path through the trees. Deep ruts in the earth are evidence of the comings and goings of wagons.<br /><br />The canopy of mist and branches suddenly gives way to black clouds boiling far above. There is a clearing here, next to a river that widens to form a small lake several hundred feet across. Five colorful round tents, each ten feet in diameter, are pitched outside a ring of four barrel-topped wagons. A much larger tent stands near the shore of the lake, its sagging form lit from within. Near this tent, eight unbridled horses drink from the river.<br /><br />The mournful strains of an accordion clash with the singing of several brightly clad figures around bonfire. A footpath continues beyond this encampment, meandering north between the river and the forest&rsquo;s edge.</blockquote>\n<br />The eight <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"NDVmYmY0YWQ5OTgx\">draft horses</a></strong> drinking from the river are used to pull the Vistani wagons and aren&rsquo;t easily startled.<br /><br />If the characters are brought to this camp by the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"NzAzZjc4MGFjNWZk\">Vistani</a>, their escorts remain at the camp and don&rsquo;t accompany the adventuring party any farther.<br /><br />Twelve Vistani (CN male and female human <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"OGYwMTAyODRiNTg3\"><strong>vistani bandits</strong></a>) are standing and sitting around the fire, telling stories and guzzling wine. They are intoxicated and have disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks. Three sober Vistani (CN male and female human <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"OGE3MjEyZjM1YzAy\"><strong>vistani bandit captains</strong></a>) are resting in three of the four wagons but leap quickly into action if an alarm is raised.<br /><br />Although the Vistani in this camp are in league with Strahd, they attack only if the characters provoke them with threats or insults. Otherwise, the characters are offered flasks of wine and invited to join the reverie.<br /><br />If the characters linger at the camp, continue with &ldquo;A Vistana&rsquo;s Tale&rdquo; below. If they seem in a hurry to leave, one of the Vistani tells them, &ldquo;It was fated that you would visit our humble camp. Madam Eva foretold your coming. She awaits you.&rdquo; The Vistana then points to the largest tent. If the characters head that way, continue with &ldquo;Madam Eva&rsquo;s Tent.&rdquo;<br /><br />\n<h4>A Vistana&rsquo;s Tale</h4>\nIf the characters linger by the fire, one of the Vistani recounts the following tale:<br /><br />\n<blockquote>&ldquo;A mighty wizard came to this land over a year ago. I remember him like it was yesterday. He stood exactly where you&rsquo;re standing. A very charismatic man, he was. He thought he could rally the people of Barovia against the devil Strahd. He stirred them with thoughts of revolt and bore them to the castle en masse.<br /><br />&ldquo;When the vampire appeared, the wizard&rsquo;s peasant army fled in terror. A few stood their ground and were never seen again.<br /><br />&ldquo;The wizard and the vampire cast spells at each other. Their battle flew from the courtyards of Ravenloft to a precipice overlooking the falls. I saw the battle with my own eyes. Thunder shook the mountainside, and great rocks tumbled down upon the wizard, yet by his magic he survived. Lightning from the heavens struck the wizard, and again he stood his ground. But when the devil Strahd fell upon him, the wizard&rsquo;s magic couldn&rsquo;t save him. I saw him thrown a thousand feet to his death. I climbed down to the river to search for the wizard&rsquo;s body, to see if, you know, he had anything of value, but the River Ivlis had already spirited him away.&rdquo;</blockquote>\n<br />The Vistana storyteller doesn&rsquo;t remember the wizard&rsquo;s name, but recalls that it sounded important. If the characters haven&rsquo;t spoken with Madam Eva, the storyteller urges them to do so.<br /><br />\n<h4>Madam Eva&rsquo;s Tent</h4>\nIf the characters decide to see <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"ZGZiYWVmNjcxZGVm\">Madam Eva</a>, read:<br /><br />\n<blockquote>Magic flames cast a reddish glow over the interior of this tent, revealing a low table covered in a black velvet cloth. Glints of light seem to flash from a crystal ball on the table as a hunched figure peers into its depths. As the crone speaks, her voice crackles like dry weeds. &ldquo;At last you have arrived!&rdquo; Cackling laughter bursts like mad lightning from her withered lips.</blockquote>\n<br /><strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"ZGZiYWVmNjcxZGVm\">Madam Eva</a></strong> speaks the name of each party member and makes some reference to that individual&rsquo;s past deeds. She then asks the characters if they want their fortunes read. If they say yes, Madam Eva produces a worn deck of cards and proceeds with the sequence outlined in chapter 1. (If the characters don&rsquo;t want a reading of their fates, continue play using the card reading you performed before starting the adventure.)<br /><br />Madam Eva might seem mad, but she is, in fact, cunning and sharp of mind. She has met a good many adventurers in her time and knows they can&rsquo;t be fully trusted. She wants to free the land of Barovia from its curse, and her fate is interwoven with Strahd&rsquo;s (see the Madam Eva bio &amp; info of her character sheet). She does the vampire&rsquo;s bidding when called upon and does nothing to anger Strahd or bring harm to the Vistani. She never gives aid and never asks for any.<br /><br />\n<h4>Treasure</h4>\nFor each Vistani tent or wagon that the characters search, roll once on the following table to determine what treasure is found:<br /><br />\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>d20</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Treasure</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1-10</td>\n<td>None</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11-13</td>\n<td>Sack of 100 ep (each coin stamped with Strahd&rsquo;s visage in profile)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14-16</td>\n<td>Pouch containing 4d6 gemstones worth 100 gp each</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17-19</td>\n<td>Sack containing 3d6 pieces of cheap jewelry worth 25 gp total and 1d6 pieces of fine jewelry worth 250 gp each</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>One magic item (roll once on <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"ZjI2YTQ3MTgyZjBm\">Magic Item Table B</a>)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<br />\n<h4><span style=\"color: #632423;\">Fortunes of Ravenloft</span></h4>\nIf your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it is hidden in one of the Vistani wagons. Madam Eva grants the characters permission to search the wagons if they ask, and any such search yields the treasure.<br /><br /><hr /><br />\n<h3>H. Tser Falls</h3>\nIf the characters reach area H by following the footpath from the Vistani encampment (area G), read:<br /><br />\n<blockquote>You follow the river to the base of a canyon, at the far end of which a great waterfall spills into a pool, billowing forth clouds of cold mist. A great stone bridge spans the canyon nearly one thousand feet overhead.</blockquote>\n<br />If the characters are on the high road instead, read:<br /><br />\n<blockquote>You follow the dirt road as it clings to the side of a mountain and ends before an arching bridge of mold-encrusted stone that spans a natural chasm. Gargoyles cloaked in black moss perch on the corners of the bridge, their frowns weatherworn. On the mountainous side of the bridge, a waterfall spills into a misty pool nearly a thousand feet below. The pool feeds a river that meanders into the fog-shrouded pines that blanket the valley.</blockquote>\n<br />The chasm&rsquo;s walls are slippery and sheer, and can&rsquo;t be scaled without the aid of magic or a climber&rsquo;s kit.<br /><br />The bridge is slick with moisture but safe to cross. The road south of the bridge leads down the mountainside to area F; the road north cuts through the mountains to area I.<br /><br />The gargoyles on the bridge are harmless sculptures.<br /><hr /><br />\n<h3>I. Black Carriage</h3>\n<blockquote>Even here, in the mountains, the forest and the fog are inescapable. Ahead, the dirt road splits in two, widening toward the east. There you see patches of cobblestone, suggesting that the eastern branch was once an important thoroughfare.</blockquote>\n<br />If Strahd has invited the characters to Castle Ravenloft or otherwise wants to steer them in his direction, add:<br /><br />\n<blockquote>Parked at the fork in the road, pointed east, is a large black carriage drawn by two black horses. The horses snort puffs of steamy breath into the chill mountain air. The side door of the carriage swings open silently.</blockquote>\n<br />The two black <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"NDVmYmY0YWQ5OTgx\">draft horses</a></strong> are under Strahd&rsquo;s control. The horses wait for the characters to pile into the carriage if they so desire. There is room inside for eight of them. If they get into the carriage, the horses draw it down the road to area J. The horses can&rsquo;t be discouraged from their course, not even by a skilled teamster.<br /><br />Characters who don&rsquo;t want to travel east in the carriage can follow the road northwest through a set of iron gates (area B) that open as they approach and close behind them, or the characters can travel south along the winding road to the bridge at Tser Falls (area H).<br /><hr /><br />\n<h3>J. Gates of Ravenloft</h3>\nThe following text assumes that the characters arrive here in the carriage from area I. Modify the text as needed if the characters arrive by another means.<br /><br />\n<blockquote>After winding through the forest and craggy mountain peaks, the road takes a sudden turn to the east, and the startling, awesome presence of Castle Ravenloft towers before you. The carriage comes to a dead stop before twin turrets of stone, broken from years of exposure. Beyond these guard towers is the precipice of a fifty-foot-wide, fog-filled chasm that disappears into unknown depths.<br /><br />A lowered drawbridge of old, shored-up wooden beams stretches across the chasm, between you and the archway to the courtyard. The chains of the drawbridge creak in the wind, their rust-eaten iron straining under the weight. From atop the high walls, stone gargoyles stare at you out of their hollow eye sockets and grin hideously. A rotting wooden portcullis, green with growth, hangs above the entry tunnel. Beyond this location, the main doors of Ravenloft stand open. A rich, warm light spills from within, flooding the courtyard. Torches flutter sadly in sconces on both sides of the open doors.</blockquote>\n<br />The drawbridge appears sturdy, but a few of its boards are missing and it creaks and groans under any weight. Each time a creature other than Strahd or a horse that draws his carriage crosses the drawbridge, there is a 5 percent chance of one of its boards breaking under the creature. If a board breaks, the creature must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall to the bottom of the cliffs, 1,000 feet below. If a companion is within 5 feet of the creature and reaches out to grab it, the creature has advantage on the save.<br /><br />\n<h4>Green Slime</h4>\nA patch of <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"MzMwNzJmNWQ5NTZh\">green slime</a> clings to the portcullis in the entry tunnel, and can be spotted with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check. The slime will not fall on characters entering the castle, but it does fall on the first character who leaves by this route.<br /><hr /><br />\n<h3>K. Castle Ravenloft</h3>\nChapter 4 explores Castle Ravenloft, lair of the vampire <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"ZTZiYzA5N2ViNTZi\">Strahd von Zarovich</a>.<br /><hr /><br />\n<h3>L. Lake Zarovich</h3>\n<blockquote>At the foot of a mountain, nestled in the misty forest, is a large lake. The water is perfectly still and dark, reflecting the black clouds overhead like a monstrous mirror.</blockquote>\n<br />If the characters arrive along the shore north of Vallaki in the daytime, add:<br /><br />\n<blockquote>Pulled up along the south shore are three small rowboats. A fourth boat can be seen in the middle of the lake, with a lone figure sitting in it, fishing pole in hand.</blockquote>\n<br />Each rowboat can safely hold five people. The person fishing on the lake is <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"ZTRlNDliNTc0YzY2\"><strong>Bluto Krogarov</strong></a> (NE male human), a resident of Vallaki. He is in a trance and doesn&rsquo;t respond to anything or anyone unless attacked. His boat is 400 feet from the nearest shore. Tied up in the boat is a seven-year-old Vistana named <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"M2FlYmU3MWJiYzdl\"><strong>Arabelle</strong></a>. She is bound with hempen rope, wrapped in a burlap sack, and lying prone so that she can&rsquo;t be seen or heard from the shore.<br /><br />\n<h4>Roleplaying Bluto</h4>\nBluto Krogarov is a destitute drunkard. He&rsquo;s desperate to catch some fish and trade them for wine at the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"N2VhNzc0NDhlZmVi\">Blue Water Inn</a>. After he was unable to catch a single fish for a week, he kidnapped Arabelle, believing that Vistani are lucky. He intends to sacrifice her to the lake, hoping it will give up some of its fish in return.<br /><br />If the characters watch Bluto from the shore for several minutes, or if they row out into the lake to greet him, he tosses the burlap sack into the water, watches it sink, and waits with fishing pole in hand for his reward.<br /><br />Bluto is a hollow shell of a man, barely able to understand his own actions. He is unarmed and does nothing to aid or thwart the characters.<br /><br />\n<h4>Roleplaying Arabelle</h4>\nCharacters who act quickly can save Arabelle before she drowns. A character on the shore must succeed on a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check to reach her in time. The DC is 10 for characters who took a rowboat out onto the lake.<br /><br />Arabelle has alabaster-white skin and raven-black hair. If rescued, she demands to be returned to her family&rsquo;s camp outside Vallaki (chapter 5, area N9). She is certain that her father, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"MjEzNzQzNGRmZTQ3\">Luvash</a>, will give the characters a reward for doing so.<br /><br />A descendant of <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"ZGZiYWVmNjcxZGVm\">Madam Eva</a> with the blood of Barovian royalty in her veins, Arabelle is unaware of her connection to Strahd. She acts more like an adult than a child. Despite her recent misadventure, she believes that a great destiny awaits her.<br /><br /><hr /><br />\n<h2>M. Mad Mage of Mount Baratok</h2>\nThis encounter can occur anywhere along the base of Mount Baratok.<br /><br />\n<blockquote>North of the mountain lake, the trees begin their steady climb up the slopes of Mount Baratok, its monolithic presence oppressive at this distance. The ground here is rocky, uneven, and tiring to navigate. Even the wolves avoid this neck of the woods. Soon, you climb above the blanket of fog that engulfs the valley. Dark thunderclouds roll overhead.<br /><br />You see an elk standing on a rocky spur about sixty feet away. Suddenly, it assumes the form of a man in tattered black robes. His hair and beard are long, black, and streaked with gray, and his eyes crackle with eldritch power.</blockquote>\n<br /><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"YTBjMzk0Yzk5NzMy\"><strong>The Mad Mage</strong></a> of Mount Baratok (CN male human) came to Barovia more than a year ago to free its people from Strahd&rsquo;s tyranny, but he underestimated Strahd&rsquo;s hold over the land and the creatures in it. After a battle between the two in Castle Ravenloft, Strahd drove the Mad Mage to the mountains and sent the wizard hurling over Tser Falls (area H). The wizard, his staff and spellbook lost, survived the fall and retreated into the mountains, hoping to regain his power, only to be driven mad by the realization that he no longer has any hope of defeating Strahd or freeing the people of the vampire&rsquo;s damned realm.<br /><br />The Mad Mage has forgotten his name and the world whence he came. In fact, he doesn&rsquo;t remember anything that happened before the madness. He suffers from the paranoia that powerful enemies are hunting him, and that their evil agents are everywhere and watching him.<br /><br />Believing that the characters aim to kill him, the Mad Mage unleashes his destructive magic. As he tears into them, he shouts, &ldquo;You think my magic has grown weak? Think again!&rdquo; If he is reduced to 50 hit points or fewer, he shouts, &ldquo;Tell your dark masters they can break my body, but never my spirit!&rdquo; He then tries to escape.<br /><br />Under normal circumstances, a <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"NWE2NjRlYWZmMGVm\">greater restoration</a></em> spell cast on the Mad Mage would restore his wits and ends the madness, allowing him to remember that he is none other than Mordenkainen, an archmage of Oerth and the leader of a powerful group of adventurers called the Circle of Eight. But in this case, the Mad Mage has cast a <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"OGZhNmRjZmFhNDFh\">mind blank</a></em> spell on himself. As long as that spell remains in effect, his sanity can&rsquo;t be restored by any spell. If the characters surmise that powerful magic is preventing them from restoring the Mad Mage&rsquo;s wits, they can, with a successful DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check, convince the Mad Mage to divulge the reason why their spell failed. A character can also ascertain the cause of the spell&rsquo;s failure with a successful DC 18 Intelligence (Arcana) check. The Mad Mage&rsquo;s <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"OGZhNmRjZmFhNDFh\">mind blank</a></em> spell has a remaining duration of 3d6 hours, after which his madness can be cured normally.<br /><br /><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"YTBjMzk0Yzk5NzMy\">The Mad Mage</a> has already used one 1st-level spell slot to cast <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"OWNmNWVhNDBjMTc3\">mage armor</a></em> on himself, one 4th-level spell slot to cast <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"MmNmOGU0ZTQ1NjM3\">polymorph</a></em> on himself, one 7th-level spell slot to cast <em><a href=\"https://5e.tools/spells.html#mordenkainen's%20magnificent%20mansion_phb\">Mordenkainen&rsquo;s magnificent mansion</a></em> (see &ldquo;The Mad Mage&rsquo;s Mansion&rdquo;), and one 8th-level spell slot to cast <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"OGZhNmRjZmFhNDFh\">mind blank</a></em> on himself.<br /><br />\n<h4>The Mad Mage&rsquo;s Mansion</h4>\nIf the characters rescue the archmage from his madness, he invites them to his &ldquo;mansion.&rdquo; He leads them up the mountain to an invisible doorway that serves as the entrance to his extradimensional lair, created using the <em><a href=\"https://5e.tools/spells.html#mordenkainen's%20magnificent%20mansion_phb\">Mordenkainen&rsquo;s magnificent mansion</a></em> spell. There, he provides them with food and sanctuary away from the prying eyes of Strahd and his spies. Characters are free to take a short or long rest, during which time they aren&rsquo;t disturbed.<br /><br />Mordenkainen is familiar with worlds beyond his own. For example, if the characters come from the Forgotten Realms and mention this fact to Mordenkainen, he asks them if they know his old friend Elminster of Shadowdale.<br /><br />If Mordenkainen isn&rsquo;t the party&rsquo;s ally as foretold in Madam Eva&rsquo;s card reading (see chapter 1), he declines to join them if asked. With his wits restored, he sets out to find his missing staff and spellbook, leaving the characters on their own. He doesn&rsquo;t allow them to help him, for he fears they might be tempted to steal either his staff or his spellbook. (Being an adventurer himself, he knows how the lure of powerful magic can bring out the worst in adventurers.) Before he leaves, as a parting gift, the archmage imbues each character with a<em> <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"OTdiNmQ5ZDc1Zjdj\">charm of heroism</a></em> (see the &ldquo;<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"NzFhMGMzMTU4ZWZm\">Supernatural Gifts</a>&rdquo; handout).<br /><br />\n<h4><span style=\"color: #632423;\">Fortunes of Ravenloft</span></h4>\nIf your card reading reveals that the Mad Mage is the party&rsquo;s ally in the battle against Strahd, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"YTBjMzk0Yzk5NzMy\">Mordenkainen</a> can be persuaded to help them once his sanity is restored. He won&rsquo;t join them on their travels, but he will help them in a fight with Strahd if they have discovered where to find the vampire and how to destroy him.<br /><br />With his sanity restored, Mordenkainen can be stubborn and difficult even with his friends, and doesn&rsquo;t suffer fools. He normally spends more time listening than talking, but when he does speak, his pronouncements are authoritative and not to be questioned.<br /><br />The archmage has never had his fortune read by Madam Eva and doesn&rsquo;t care to, but if he is told about the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"YmY5ZjM2YTY3ZDgz\"><em>Holy Symbol of Ravenkind</em></a>, the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"OGIyOGYxMWU1ODgw\"><em>Tome of Strahd</em></a>, and the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"MGZkYThiODViN2Yw\"><em>Sunsword</em></a>, he insists that these items be recovered before he and the party confront Strahd. If Strahd is defeated and Mordenkainen survives, the archmage gladly accompanies the characters back to their world if they invite him, if only not to disappoint them.<br /><hr /><br />\n<h3>N. Town of Vallaki</h3>\nChapter 5 describes the town of <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"YWIzMjIyNzE0OGFk\">Vallaki</a>.<br /><hr /><br />\n<h3>O. Old Bonegrinder</h3>\nChapter 6 details <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"MDYyMDU5ZmM4Y2I1\">Old Bonegrinder</a>, a decrepit windmill occupied by hags.<br /><hr /><br />\n<h3>P. Luna River Crossroads</h3>\nAlways check for a random encounter when the characters reach area P in their travels.<br /><br />\n<blockquote>The road comes to an X intersection, with branches to the northwest, northeast, southwest, and southeast. The lower half of a snapped wooden signpost thrusts upward at an angle near the eastern elbow of the intersection. The top half of the sign, featuring arms pointing in four directions, lies in the weeds nearby.</blockquote>\n<br />The characters can easily figure out how the top half of the signpost connects to the lower half. When the two parts of the sign are aligned and rejoined, the arms indicate KREZK and TSOLENKA PASS to the southwest, LAKE BARATOK to the northwest, VALLAKI and RAVENLOFT to the northeast, and BEREZ to the southeast.<br /><br />The Old Svalich Road, which runs northeast to southwest between Vallaki (area N) and <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"OWRkMTE5ZDk1Mjg2\">Krezk</a> (area S), is generally level. About a quarter mile along the northeast branch, an arching stone bridge crosses the Luna River.<br /><br />The northwest branch of the crossroads climbs gently, becoming a dirt trail through the woods within half a mile. It merges with the Old Svalich Road again after a couple of miles, but not before sprouting a branch that leads to <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"YzI4NTRlMTIxMTFk\">Van Richten&rsquo;s Tower</a> on Lake Baratok (area V). The southeast branch wends gently downward as it follows the river into a valley. This trail eventually ends at the mostly abandoned riverside burg of <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"NTkwZjliZmMwNGQ2\">Berez</a> (area U).<br /><hr /><br />\n<h3>Q. Argynvostholt</h3>\nChapter 7 details the ruined mansion <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"OGZkMWVkZjExOTc5\">Argynvostholt</a>, once a refuge of the Order of the Silver Dragon, which opposed Strahd and failed.<br /><hr /><br />\n<h3>R. Raven River Crossroads</h3>\nAlways check for a random encounter whenever the characters reach area R.<br /><br />This stretch of the Old Svalich Road has multiple branches. One branch heads north, quickly turning into a dirt path that leads to <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"YzI4NTRlMTIxMTFk\">Van Richten&rsquo;s Tower</a> on Lake Baratok (area V). One branch heads south, becoming <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"MTE0NDVmZTc2Nzlk\">Tsolenka Pass</a> (area T) as it winds through the lower mountains and clings to the side of Mount Ghakis. A third branch heads west toward the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"ZTRkYjc1NzhiYjcz\">Wizard of Wines winery</a> and vineyard (area W), dipping south as it changes from a road into a gravel trail.<br /><br />Standing at the intersection of the Old Svalich Road and the road to the winery is a signpost:<br /><br />\n<blockquote>You see a weatherworn signpost next to the road. The three arms of the sign point along the three branches of the road. The arm pointing north reads KREZK, and through the woods you can see an arching stone bridge spanning a river. The arm pointing east reads VALLAKI, and the road slopes up gradually in that direction. The arm pointing southwest reads THE WIZARD OF WINES. The road slopes gently downward in that direction.</blockquote>\n<hr /><br />\n<h3>S. Village of Krezk</h3>\nChapter 8 visits the village of <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"OWRkMTE5ZDk1Mjg2\">Krezk</a> and the nearby Abbey of Saint Markovia.<br /><hr /><br />\n<h3>T. Tsolenka Pass</h3>\nChapter 9 explores the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"MTE0NDVmZTc2Nzlk\">Tsolenka Pass</a>, which hugs the side of Mount Ghakis.<br /><hr /><br />\n<h3>U. Ruins of Berez</h3>\nChapter 10 describes the ruins of <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"NTkwZjliZmMwNGQ2\">Berez</a>, a riverside village that is now home to the hag <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"YjUxYzI2NDk0ZDIz\">Baba Lysaga</a>.<br /><hr /><br />\n<h3>V. Van Richten&rsquo;s Tower</h3>\nChapter 11 details <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"YzI4NTRlMTIxMTFk\">Van Richten&rsquo;s Tower</a>, a dilapidated structure that originally belonged to the wizard Khazan.<br /><hr /><br />\n<h3>W. The Wizard of Wines</h3>\nChapter 12 visits the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"ZTRkYjc1NzhiYjcz\">Wizard of Wines</a>, the vineyard and winery that provides Barovia much of its wine.<br /><hr /><br />\n<h3>X. The Amber Temple</h3>\nChapter 13 delves into the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"ZmRiYTJmZWRkNmVm\">Amber Temple</a>, the dungeon complex where Strahd gave himself to the Dark Powers.<br /><br /><hr /><br />\n<h3>Y. Yester Hill</h3>\nChapter 14 describes <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"ZWI2YTFiNTM4ZWFk\">Yester Hill</a>, a remote hilltop that belongs to <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"YTdmMjgwYzBiMTA2\">druids</a> who venerate Strahd as lord of the land.<br /><hr /><br />\n<h3>Z. Werewolf Den</h3>\nChapter 15 delves into the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"YTVjNmQ2ZmVkZGY5\">cave complex</a> that is the main den of Barovia&rsquo;s werewolves.</section>","img":"modules/cor-cos/journal/002_-_Chapter_2_3A_The_Lands_of_Barovia/007_-_Areas_of_Barovia/avatar.webp"}

Church</h3><blockquote>Atop a slight rise, against the roots of the pillar stone that supports Castle Ravenloft, stands a gray, sagging edifice of stone and wood. This church has obviously weathered the assaults of evil for centuries on end and is worn and weary. A bell tower rises toward the back, and flickering light shines through holes in the shingled roof. The rafters strain feebly against their load.</blockquote><br>If the characters approach the church doors, add:<br><br><blockquote>The heavy wooden doors of the church are covered with claw marks and scarred by fire.</blockquote><br>The village priest, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZjIxMDYwN2RhZjcx ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Donavich</a>, lives here. Other Barov­ians shun the church for reasons that will quickly become obvious.<br><br>The following areas correspond to labels on the map of the church.<br><br><h4>E5a. Hall</h4><blockquote>The doors open to reveal a ten-foot-wide, twenty-foot-long hall leading to a brightly lit chapel. The hall is unlit and reeks of mildew. Four doors, two on each side of the hall, lead to adjacent chambers.<br><br>You can see that the chapel is strewn with debris, and you hear a soft voice from within reciting a prayer. Suddenly, the prayer is blotted out by an inhuman scream that rises up from beneath the wooden floor.</blockquote><br>The scream comes from the church’s undercroft (area E5g). The soft voice uttering the prayer belongs to <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZjIxMDYwN2RhZjcx ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Donavich</a>, the priest (see area E5f).<br><br><h4>E5b. Doru’s Bedroom</h4><blockquote>This dirty, lightless room contains a wooden bed with a straw-filled mattress. Mounted above the bed’s headboard is a wooden holy symbol.</blockquote><br>This room once belonged to <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YTk4Y2EzYWNiODM0 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Doru</a>, Donavich’s son, who is trapped in the undercroft (area E5g). It hasn’t been used in more than a year and contains nothing of value.<br><br><h4>E5c. Donavich’s Bedroom</h4><blockquote>This dirty room contains a wooden bed with a straw-filled mattress, next to which rests a small table with an oil lamp burning brightly on it. Mounted above the bed’s headboard is a wooden sun-shaped holy symbol.</blockquote><br>This is Donavich’s room and contains nothing of value.<br><br><h4>E5d. Trapdoor</h4><blockquote>Time and neglect have punched holes in the ceiling of this moldy room, which contains a few broken roof shingles amid puddles of water. In one corner, set into the floor, is a heavy wooden trapdoor held shut with a chain and a padlock. A young man’s screams of anguish can be heard through the door.</blockquote><br><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZjIxMDYwN2RhZjcx ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Donavich</a> lost the key to the iron padlock. If the chain is removed and the trapdoor is opened, the screaming in the undercroft stops. The trapdoor is swollen and stuck in its frame, so that a successful DC 12 Strength check is required to pull it open. Below it is a wooden staircase that descends 15 feet into the undercroft (area E5g).<br><hr><br><h3>E5e. Office</h3><blockquote>An old desk and chair stand against the south wall, a wooden holy symbol mounted above them—a sunburst. A ten-foot-long iron rod attached to the north wall stands bare, suggesting a tapestry once hung there. Against the far wall stands a wooden cabinet with four tall doors.</blockquote><br>An empty wooden poor box rests on the seat of the chair. The desk drawers contain a few sheets of blank parchment, along with a couple of quill pens and dried-up jars of ink.<br><br>For its size, the wooden cabinet contains very little. Inside are a tinderbox, a few wooden boxes full of candles, and two well-used books: <em>Hymns to the Dawn</em>, a volume of chants to the Morninglord, and <em>The Blade of Truth: The Uses of Logic in the War Against Diabolist Heresies, as Fought by the Ulmist Inquisition</em>, a strange book that mixes logic exercises with lurid descriptions of fiend-worshiping cults.<br><hr><h3>E5f. Chapel</h3><blockquote>The chapel is a shambles, with overturned and broken pews littering the dusty floor. Dozens of candles mounted in candlesticks and candelabras light every dusty corner in a fervent attempt to rid the chapel of shadows. At the far end of the church sits a claw-scarred altar, behind which kneels a priest in soiled vestments. Next to him hangs a long, thick rope that stretches up into the bell tower.</blockquote><br>If the characters have not already entered the undercroft, add:<br><br><blockquote>From beneath the chapel floor, you hear a young man’s voice cry out, “Father! I’m starving!”</blockquote><br><strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZjIxMDYwN2RhZjcx ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Donavich</a></strong> (LG male human) has been praying throughout the night. His voice is hoarse and weak. He is, in a word, insane. A little more than a year ago, his twenty-year-old son <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YTk4Y2EzYWNiODM0 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Doru</a> and several other villagers stormed Castle Ravenloft in revolt, having been lured there by a wizard in black robes who came to Barovia from a faraway land (see <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YTBjMzk0Yzk5NzMy ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>The Mad Mage</a> entry for more information on the wizard). By all accounts, the wizard died by Strahd’s hand, and so too did Doru, who returned to his father as a vampire spawn. Donavich was able to trap his son in the church’s undercroft, where he remains to this day.<br><br>Doru hasn’t fed since he was imprisoned, and he cries out to his father at all hours. Meanwhile, Donavich prays day and night, hoping that the gods will tell him how to save Doru without destroying him. If the characters seem intent on slaying Doru, Donavich does his best to stop them. If Doru dies, Donavich falls to the floor and weeps inconsolably, overcome with despair.<br><br>In addition to the lore known to all <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NDM2ZTc2NDNmODQw ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Barovians</a> (see “<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NDM2ZTc2NDNmODQw ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Barovian Lore</a>” in chapter 2), Donavich knows the following useful information:<br><br><ul><li>Ireena Kolyana isn’t the natural daughter of Kolyan Indirovich. Although Ireena never knew, Kolyan found her at the edge of the Svalich Woods near the Pillarstone of Ravenloft. She was but a girl then and seemed to have no memory of her past. Kolyan adopted her and loved her dearly.</li><li>Every night at midnight, the spirits of dead adventurers rise up out of the church graveyard, forming a silent procession as they walk the road toward Castle Ravenloft. (See “March of the Dead” in the “<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YmE3MmE1NmUyMjEx ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Special Events</a>” section.)</li></ul><br><strong><em>Funeral for the Burgomaster.</em></strong> If the characters bring Kolyan Indirovich’s body to the church, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZjIxMDYwN2RhZjcx ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Donavich</a> presses the characters into helping him bury the burgomaster in the cemetery (area E6) at dawn. During the burial, Donavich offers prayers to the Morning­lord in exchange for Kolyan Indirovich’s deliverance from Barovia.<br><br>Once Kolyan is put in the ground, Donavich suggests that Ireena be taken as far from Castle Ravenloft as possible. He proposes that the characters take her to the Abbey of Saint Markovia in <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=OWRkMTE5ZDk1Mjg2 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Krezk</a> (chapter 8) or, failing that, the fortified town of <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YWIzMjIyNzE0OGFk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Vallaki</a> (chapter 5). Donavich is unaware that the abbey, once a bastion of good, has become a den of evil.<br><hr><h3>E5g. Undercroft</h3><blockquote>The church’s undercroft has rough-hewn walls and a floor made of damp clay and earth. Rotting wooden pillars strain under the weight of the wooden ceiling. Candlelight from the chapel above slips though the cracks, allowing you to glimpse a gaunt shape in the far corner.</blockquote><br>The shape is <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YTk4Y2EzYWNiODM0 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Doru</a></strong>, a vampire spawn sent by Strahd to torment <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZjIxMDYwN2RhZjcx ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Donavich</a> and cast down the church. Doru is starved for blood and brave enough to attack a lone character. If the characters approach as a group, he does his best to avoid them while hissing, “I can smell your blood!” If they cut off his escape, he lunges forth and attacks.<br><br>If the characters restrain Doru and either promise him blood or threaten to destroy him, or if they kill him and then raise him from the dead, he recounts the events that led to his downfall (see area E5f).<br><br><h4><span style=\"color: rgb( 99 , 36 , 35 )\">Fortunes of Ravenloft</span></h4>If your card reading reveals that a treasure is in the undercroft, it’s contained in a moldy, old chest in the southwest corner of the room.

As a result, Barovians have a wide variety of ethnic backgrounds.<br><br>Barovians are deeply invested in their homes and their traditions. They are wary of strange peoples and customs. The way Barovians deal with strangers can be unsettling to those newcomers. Barovians have a tendency to stare openly, in silence, thereby expressing their disapproval of anything that isn’t familiar to them. Barovians aren’t talkative with strangers, to the extent of being pointedly rude. Most Barovians have violent tempers that boil up through their customary silence when they are provoked. They also have a social cohesiveness (thrust upon them by their weird circumstances) that can make them act together against outsiders if a Barovian is mistreated.<br><br>Barovians were a happy people once, but their history and current conditions aren’t pleasant. If one manages to win the trust of a Barovian, one has a friend for life and a stalwart ally.<br><br>Barovian children aren’t happy children. They are raised in a culture of fear and told time and again not to wander too far from their homes or enter the woods. They experience little hope or joy, and they are taught to fear the devil Strahd above all.<br><br>Barovian adults eke out modest livings. With no new wealth pouring into the valley, they trade in old coins that bear the profile of their dark lord, Strahd, as he looked when he was alive. They hide their precious baubles in their houses and dress plainly outdoors, so as not to attract the attention of Strahd or his spies.<br><br>Barovians live within a closed ecosystem. Every Barovian adult is expected to learn a trade or serve a function. Barovians stitch their own clothing, craft their own furniture, grow their own food, and make their own wine. With fewer than three thousand people living in the entire valley, finding the perfect mate isn’t easy, so Barovians have learned to settle for what they can get.<br><br><h3>Souls and Shells</h3>Barovians are made of flesh and blood. They are born, they live, they age, and they die. But not all of them—only about one in every ten—have souls.<br><br>When a being with a soul dies in Barovia, that soul remains trapped in Strahd’s domain until it is reincarnated in a newborn. It can take decades for a bodiless soul to find a host, and Barovians who share the same soul over generations tend to look alike. That is why <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YjY2YzRmODJjYmNl ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Ireena Kolyana</a> looks exactly like Strahd’s beloved <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MDI3ODg0YjAyZTM4 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Tatyana</a>—both women were born with the same soul.<br><br>Strahd needs loyal subjects to feed his ego. Barovians without souls are empty shells created by his consciousness to fill out the local population. Although they are physically indistinguishable from Barovians with souls, they tend to be bereft of charm and imagination and to be more compliant and depressed than the others. They dress in drab clothing, whereas Barovians who have souls wear clothes with a splash of color or individuality.<br><br>A Barovian woman, soulless or not, can give birth. A child born in Barovia might have a soul even if one or both parents do not. Conversely, the child of two parents with souls isn’t certain to have a soul of its own. Barovians without souls are maudlin folk who experience fear but neither laugh nor cry.<br><br>Ireena Kolyana and her brother Ismark both have souls, as do all <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NzAzZjc4MGFjNWZk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Vistani</a>. Which Barovians have souls and which don’t is left up to you.<br><br>Strahd periodically feeds on the blood of Barovians who have souls, but he can’t draw nourishment from the blood of the soulless. He can tell at a glance whether a Barovian has a soul or is merely a shell.<br><br>If Strahd is defeated, the fog that surrounds Barovia fades away, allowing the inhabitants of the valley to leave if they wish. Only those who have souls, however, can truly leave this place. Soulless Barovians cease to exist as soon as they exit the valley.<br><br><h3>Barovian Names</h3>You can use the following lists to create Barovian NPC names on the fly.<br><br><strong>Male Names:</strong> Alek, Andrej, Anton, Balthazar, Bogan, Boris, Dargos, Darzin, Dragomir, Emeric, Falkon, Frederich, Franz, Gargosh, Gorek, Grygori, Hans, Harkus, Ivan, Jirko, Kobal, Korga, Krystofor, Lazlo, Livius, Marek, Miroslav, Nikolaj, Nimir, Oleg, Radovan, Radu, Seraz, Sergei, Stefan, Tural, Valentin, Vasily, Vladislav, Waltar, Yesper, Zsolt<br><br><strong>Female Names:</strong> Alana, Clavdia, Danya, Dezdrelda, Diavola, Dorina, Drasha, Drilvia, Elisabeta, Fatima, Grilsha, Isabella, Ivana, Jarzinka, Kala, Katerina, Kereza, Korina, Lavinia, Magda, Marta, Mathilda, Minodora, Mirabel, Miruna, Nimira, Nyanka, Olivenka, Ruxandra, Sorina, Tereska, Valentina, Vasha, Victoria, Wensencia, Zondra<br><br><strong>Family Names:</strong> Alastroi, Antonovich/Antonova, Barthos, Belasco, Cantemir, Dargovich/Dargova, Diavolov, Diminski, Dilisnya, Drazkoi, Garvinski, Grejenko, Groza, Grygorovich/Grygorova, Ivanovich/Ivanova, Janek, Karushkin, Konstantinovich/Konstantinova, Krezkov/Krezkova, Krykski, Lansten, Lazarescu, Lukresh, Lipsiege, Martikov/Martikova, Mironovich/Mironovna, Moldovar, Nikolovich/Nikolova, Nimirovich/Nimirova, Oronovich/Oronova, Petrovich/Petrovna, Polensky, Radovich/Radova, Rilsky, Stefanovich/Stefanova, Strazni, Swilovich/Swilova, Taltos, Targolov/Targolova, Tyminski, Ulbrek, Ulrich, Vadu, Voltanescu, Zalenski, Zalken<br><br><h3>Barovians and Nonhumans</h3>Barovians are human. Although they know that dwarves, elves, halflings and other civilized races exist, few living Barovians have seen such “creatures,” let alone interacted with them.<br><br>Aside from the secretive dusk elves of <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YWIzMjIyNzE0OGFk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Vallaki</a> (see chapter 5), the only nonhumans most Barovians are familiar with are the adventurers that Strahd has lured to his dark realm. Barovians thus react to nonhuman characters the same way most humans in the real world would react to elf, dwarf, or half-orc adventurers suddenly walking the streets. Most such outsiders are scorned, feared, or shunned.<br><br><h3>Barovian Lore</h3>Typical Barovians know certain facts, or have certain beliefs, about their existence and their surroundings. This common lore is summarized here. Characters can learn this information after earning a Barovian’s trust.<br><br><h4>The Devil Strahd</h4>About Strahd and vampires, the Barovians believe the following:<br><br><ul><li>Strahd von Zarovich is a vampire, and he dwells in Castle Ravenloft. No one is welcome at the castle.</li><li>The devil Strahd is a curse placed on the land because of a forgotten sin of the Barovians’ ancestors. (This is untrue, but Barovians believe it nonetheless.)</li><li>A vampire must rest in its coffin during the day. At night, it can summon wolves and vermin to do its bidding. A vampire can transform into a bat, a wolf, or a cloud of mist. In its humanoid form, it can dominate you with its powerful gaze.</li><li>A vampire can’t enter a residence without an invitation from one of the occupants.</li><li>Running water burns a vampire like acid, and sunlight causes a vampire to burst into flame.</li></ul><br><h4>The Land of Barovia</h4>Barovians know the following facts about their homeland:<br><br><ul><li>Anyone who attempts to leave the land of Barovia begins to choke on the fog. Those who don’t turn back perish.</li><li>Many strangers have been drawn to Barovia over the years, but they all die or disappear before long.</li><li>Wolves, dire wolves, and werewolves prowl the Svalich Woods, and hungry bats fill the skies at night.</li><li>The village of Barovia sits at the east end of the valley. Its burgomaster is named Kolyan Indirovich.</li><li>The town of Vallaki lies in the heart of the valley. Its burgomaster is named Baron Vargas Vallakovich.</li><li>The fortified village of Krezk lies at the west end of the valley and is built around an old abbey. The village burgomaster is named Dmitri Krezkov.</li><li>Wine is the lifeblood of Barovia—for some, it is the only reason to keep living. Barovian taverns get their wine from the Wizard of Wines winery near Krezk.</li><li>A mad wizard of great power haunts the foothills of Mount Baratok. He is an outsider and no friend of the vampire’s.</li></ul><br><h4>Beliefs and Superstitions</h4>Barovians have deep-rooted religious beliefs and superstitions that they pass down from one generation to the next:<br><br><ul><li>Two divine forces watch over the Barovian people: the Morninglord and Mother Night.</li><li>Before the curse of Strahd befell the land, the Morninglord watched over the Barovian people from sunrise until sundown. Now, the sun has not shone unobscured for centuries, and the Morninglord no longer answers their prayers.</li><li>The presence of Mother Night is felt most strongly between dusk and dawn, although nighttime prayers to her go unanswered. It is widely believed that she has forsaken the Barovian people and sent the devil Strahd to punish them for their ancestors’ offenses.</li><li>Spirits drift along the Old Svalich Road toward Castle Ravenloft in the dead of night. These phantoms are all that remain of Strahd’s enemies, and this damnable fate awaits anyone who opposes him.</li><li>The Vistani serve the devil Strahd. They alone are allowed to leave Barovia.</li><li>Never harm a raven, lest ill fortune befall you!</li></ul><br><h3>Barovian Calendar</h3>Barovia has its own calendar, and Barovians are accustomed to measuring the passage of time in “moons” instead of months. As a measurement of time, each moon begins on the first night of a full moon and lasts a full lunar cycle. A year consists of twelve moons, or twelve lunar cycles.<br><br>Strahd was born in 306. In 346, he inherited his father’s crown, lands, and army. Strahd conquered the valley in 347, finished construction of Castle Ravenloft in 350, and died and became a vampire in 351. The current year is 735.<br></section>","img":"modules/cor-cos/journal/002_-_Chapter_2_3A_The_Lands_of_Barovia/003_-_Barovians/avatar.webp"}

She has nothing but dislike or disdain for anyone other than herself, and she loves being alone (except for the company of minions and other creatures under her sway). That’s the ordinary state of affairs. But when a group of hags have a common goal or they seek greater power to combat a formidable threat, they suppress their basic nature and come together to do their work.

This arrangement is potentially a dangerous proposition for the mortal, but a pair of hags might agree to it if their needs are served. For instance, a human member of a coven makes an ideal spy and infiltrator in and around a humanoid settlement.</section>","img":""}

It is one of the only indulgences left to them. Without it, many Barovians would lose their last shred of hope and succumb to utter despair.<br><br>Although the Vistani often bring wine from distant lands, they share it infrequently. Thus, most of Barovia’s wine comes from one source: the Wizard of Wines winery and vineyard.<br><br>The Wizard of Wines was founded by a mage whose name is buried in the annals of history. The wizard fashioned three magic gems, each one as big as a pinecone, and planted them in the rich valley soil. These “seeds” gave rise to healthy grapevines, which produced sweet, plump grapes. Even after Strahd’s curse settled over Barovia, the gems kept the vines and their grapes from succumbing to the darkness.<br><br>Strahd bequeathed the winery and vineyard to the noble Krezkov family as a reward for the family’s loyalty. Later, an arranged marriage between the Krezkovs and the Martikov family led to the land being taken over by a Martikov descendant. The winery and vineyard have been tended by the Martikovs ever since. At some point, the Martikov family became infected with widespread lycanthropy. The current patriarch, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=Mzg3YWU3MzQ3MjRm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Davian Martikov</a>, is a <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NzBhNmIwNTcxN2Y0 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>wereraven</a>, as are his children and grandchildren.<br><br>The wereravens provide the wine to Barovian taverns for free, knowing the good it brings to the Barovian people.<br><br>The winery is known for three wines: the unremarkable Purple Grapemash No. 3, the slightly more tantalizing Red Dragon Crush, and the rich Champagne du le Stomp. Ten years ago, one of the vineyard’s magic gems was dug up and stolen, and as a result, the winery stopped producing its best vintage, the champagne. No one knows what happened to the gem. Davian Martikov blames his middle son, Urwin (see chapter 5, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=N2VhNzc0NDhlZmVi ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Blue Water Inn</a>), for the loss because Urwin was on watch the night the gem was taken. Davian is convinced that Urwin shirked his duty to spend time with his betrothed, and the two men have been at odds ever since. To this day, Urwin steadfastly denies his father’s accusation.<br><br>Adding to Davian’s misery, the wereravens have been fending off frequent attacks by Baba Lysaga’s scarecrow constructs. Three weeks ago, during one such attack, another gem was found, dug up, and taken. Davian believes that it is in the possession of <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YjUxYzI2NDk0ZDIz ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Baba Lysaga</a> (see chapter 10, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NTkwZjliZmMwNGQ2 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area U3</a>).<br><br>Davian’s belief is correct. The gem was a lucky find for Baba Lysaga, who had previously suspected that magic was the root of the vineyard’s health but knew nothing of its source. Even after this great discovery, Baba Lysaga continues to send her scarecrows against the winery, antagonizing the wereravens like a bad neighbor.<br><br>Five days ago, evil <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YTdmMjgwYzBiMTA2 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>druids</a> stole the third and final gem and bore it to <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZWI2YTFiNTM4ZWFk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Yester Hill</a> (chapter 14). The wereravens launched a counterattack on Yester Hill, hoping to get it back, but to no avail. The druids and their blights proved more than a match for the lycanthropes.<br><br>Two days ago, the druids returned with a horde of blights and drove Davian’s family from the winery. They’ve also poisoned the fermentation vats, leaving the winery with only a few bottles and barrels of drinkable wine.<br><br>Even if the characters succeed in helping the Martikovs reclaim the winery, wine production in the valley will eventually stop as the vineyard dies off. Only by recovering the magic gems and replanting them in the soil can the characters ensure that the Barovians aren’t without wine to comfort them on dark, wretched nights.<br><br><blockquote>\"Why, it is nothing to become an animal, for that is the true nature of every man. We are not meant to wear crowns and drink from goblets.\"</blockquote><div style=\"text-align: right\"><em>—</em>Strahd von Zarovich</div><br></section>","img":""}

The vampire must be in his resting place to be utterly destroyed.<br><br>If the characters finish off Strahd in his coffin, read:<br><br><blockquote>Strahd can’t hide his surprise as death takes him into the black abyss. Surprise turns to rage, and the Pillarstone of Ravenloft trembles with fury, shaking dust from the ceiling of the vampire’s tomb. The shudders abate as Strahd’s burning hatred melts away, replaced at last with relief. The dark orbs of his eyes wither and sink into his skull as his corpse deteriorates before you. In a matter of moments, only bones, dust, and noble garb remain. Strahd von Zarovich, the dark lord of Barovia, is dead and gone.</blockquote><br><h3>Rahadin’s Revenge</h3>If <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTZiYzA5N2ViNTZi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Strahd</a> dies but <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=M2NlY2IzOWI5Nzhi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Rahadin</a></strong> yet lives, the dusk elf chamberlain appears moments after Strahd’s demise. When that occurs, read:<br><br><blockquote>“Master!” says a voice from behind you. An elf with dusky brown skin and long black hair, his face a mask of terror, looks on what you have wrought and screams.</blockquote><br>Rahadin has served Strahd’s family for hundreds of years and doesn’t take his master’s defeat well. The dusk elf chamberlain draws his scimitar and tries to avenge Strahd. Grief-stricken, he can’t be reasoned with.<br><br><h3>Sergei and Ireena</h3>This optional scene can be used after Strahd has been defeated. It assumes that <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YjY2YzRmODJjYmNl ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Ireena Kolyana</a> survived the adventure and hasn’t yet been reunited with Sergei.<br><br>On the morning after Strahd’s demise, the characters feel drawn to Castle Ravenloft’s overlook (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NTZhOGQwMTVjZmM4 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>chapter 5, area K6</a>), and there they witness the following scene.<br><br><blockquote>Thick clouds fill the sky. Through the chilly morning mists, the land of Barovia is visible far below. There is peacefulness here. Rest has come to the valley for the first time anyone can remember.<br><br>A light flashes behind you. Wheeling around, you see a stately man—a being of flesh and blood—in shining armor and a flapping cape. His countenance shows great strength of will, yet the forcefulness of his presence is tempered by his calm, sad eyes. His features are those of Strahd, yet subtly different.<br><br>His voice is calm and peaceful. “My name is Sergei von Zarovich.” He turns to Ireena. “Tatyana, the time is at hand to rest. Come, my love and wife.” He stretches forth his hand.<br><br>Ireena Kolyana’s questioning eyes suddenly open with recognition and knowledge. Forgotten memories rush back to her. “Sergei!” she cries, springing to him with the grace of a doe. They embrace.<br><br>Ireena turns to you and says, “I am Ireena Kolyana, but in my past I was Sergei’s beloved Tatyana. Through these many centuries we have played out the tragedy of our lives. Now, with our deepest gratitude to you, that tragedy is over. It is time for joy to begin again.”<br><br>Shimmering light surrounds Ireena and Sergei. Hand in hand, they walk east toward the edge of the overlook. Their feet do not touch the ground as they tread a path beyond this mortal world. Their invisible road takes them beyond the eastern precipice, their glow illuminating and thinning the clouds above Barovia. The clouds suddenly break open, letting shafts of glorious sunlight flood through. In the valley below, the strange fog dissolves. Barovia is free once more.</blockquote><br><h3>Escape from Barovia</h3>Strahd’s death grants Barovia a reprieve. The fog that surrounds the land thins, and it no longer harms those who pass through it. The dark clouds that have loomed over the valley for centuries give way to sunshine, shocking the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NDM2ZTc2NDNmODQw ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Barovians</a> out of their despair.<br><br>The Barovians take the sunlight as a sign that the evil in their land has been purged. Though escape is now possible, most Barovians realize that they have nowhere to go and no reason to leave. A few depart, fearing the return of the darkness or longing to see their ancestral homelands. Those who have souls can leave the valley, while those without souls fade into nothingness as they take their first steps beyond the edge of Strahd’s former domain.<br><br><h3>Aftermath</h3>The bats, wolves, and dire wolves of Barovia lose their supernatural link to Strahd upon his destruction and become ordinary beasts, destined to be hunted down or driven to the farthest reaches of the Svalich Woods.<br><br>Even after Strahd’s death, Castle Ravenloft remains a haunted place shunned by all Barovians. Its dark immensity and threatening countenance are enough to deter locals from plundering or reoccupying it.<br><br><h4>The Rise of Ismark</h4>If he survives the adventure, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OTc3YTUzMjU0Njc3 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Ismark Kolyanovich</a> becomes burgomaster of the village of Barovia. He is grateful to the characters for all they have accomplished and urges them to stay in Barovia and help him rid the land of its other threats, offering his village as a safe haven.<br><br><h4>Vistani Exodus</h4>Fearing that the Barovians might kill them for being spies and collaborators, the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NzAzZjc4MGFjNWZk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Vistani</a> pack up their wagons and leave the valley with great haste. The Barovians are happy to see them go.<br><br><h4>Vampire Hunters</h4>If he is still alive, Rudolph van Richten (see <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MTY5MmZlODgzNzJi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Rictavio</a>) leaves Barovia to live out his remaining days in solitude. His protégé, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTFlNDZhMzkxNDAy ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Ezmerelda d’Avenir</a>, isn’t convinced that Strahd is truly dead. She also knows that there are other evils in Barovia to be conquered, so she elects to remain in the valley.<br><br><h4>Consorts Unleashed</h4>Upon his death, Strahd’s vampire spawn are freed from his control, and each seeks a new destiny. <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZmYxNWNkOWY3Y2Fj ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Escher</a>, in particular, leaves the realm, in search of new experiences and a way to become a vampire lord himself.<br><br>If <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NjcyNWRkZmY0YzFi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Patrina Velikovna</a> lives, she begins to plunder arcane knowledge from Castle Ravenloft and the Amber Temple and prepares to become Barovia’s new master.<br><br><h4>Strahd’s Return</h4>Ezmerelda’s suspicion proves justified. Strahd’s destruction is temporary, for his curse can’t so easily be ended. The ancient Dark Powers with which <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTZiYzA5N2ViNTZi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Strahd</a> forged his pact cause the vampire to re-form after a period of months—long enough for the Barovians to discover what it feels like to live a life of hope. When Strahd is reborn, the mists surround the land of Barovia once more, and the Barovians’ hope turns to horrible despair. Strahd remembers the defeat dealt to him and begins plotting his revenge.<br><br>After the mists reappear, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZGZiYWVmNjcxZGVm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Madam Eva</a> and her <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NzAzZjc4MGFjNWZk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Vistani</a> come back to the valley, the beasts of the land once more fall under Strahd’s spell, and the burgomasters fortify their settlements, hoping against all hope that someone can save them from Strahd again.<br></section>","img":"modules/cor-cos/journal/016_-_Epilogue/002_-_Strahd_Dies/avatar.webp"}

Gates of Ravenloft</h3>The following text assumes that the characters arrive here in the carriage from area I. Modify the text as needed if the characters arrive by another means.<br><br><blockquote>After winding through the forest and craggy mountain peaks, the road takes a sudden turn to the east, and the startling, awesome presence of Castle Ravenloft towers before you. The carriage comes to a dead stop before twin turrets of stone, broken from years of exposure. Beyond these guard towers is the precipice of a fifty-foot-wide, fog-filled chasm that disappears into unknown depths.<br><br>A lowered drawbridge of old, shored-up wooden beams stretches across the chasm, between you and the archway to the courtyard. The chains of the drawbridge creak in the wind, their rust-eaten iron straining under the weight. From atop the high walls, stone gargoyles stare at you out of their hollow eye sockets and grin hideously. A rotting wooden portcullis, green with growth, hangs above the entry tunnel. Beyond this location, the main doors of Ravenloft stand open. A rich, warm light spills from within, flooding the courtyard. Torches flutter sadly in sconces on both sides of the open doors.</blockquote><br>The drawbridge appears sturdy, but a few of its boards are missing and it creaks and groans under any weight. Each time a creature other than Strahd or a horse that draws his carriage crosses the drawbridge, there is a 5 percent chance of one of its boards breaking under the creature. If a board breaks, the creature must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall to the bottom of the cliffs, 1,000 feet below. If a companion is within 5 feet of the creature and reaches out to grab it, the creature has advantage on the save.<br><br><h4>Green Slime</h4>A patch of <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MzMwNzJmNWQ5NTZh ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>green slime</a> clings to the portcullis in the entry tunnel, and can be spotted with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check. The slime will not fall on characters entering the castle, but it does fall on the first character who leaves by this route.<br><br><hr><br><h2>Walls of Ravenloft</h2>Refer to Ravenloft Map 2 for areas K1 through K6.<br><br><h3>K1. Front Courtyard</h3>As the characters enter the castle, the weather worsens. Dismal rain starts to fall, becoming a torrent within the hour. Lightning routinely lights the sky, followed by peals of thunder that make the castle shudder.<br><br><blockquote>Thick, cold fog swirls in this courtyard. Sporadic flashes of lightning lance the weeping clouds overhead as thunder shakes the ground. Through the drizzle, you see torch flames fluttering on each side of the keep’s open main doors. Warm light spills out of the entrance, flooding the courtyard. High above the entrance is a round window with shards of broken glass lodged in its iron frame. </blockquote><br>The walls that enclose the courtyard are 90 feet high. The dark towers of the castle rise even higher. Doors in the gate towers on each side of the tunnel entrance are shut against the rain, and a howling wind rushes through the courtyard.<br><br>The open main doors to the keep lead to <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZmU0Yjk2NzNiY2U4 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K7</a>. The large, shattered window overlooking the main entrance is 50 feet above the courtyard and leads to <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=Yjc3NTVkZDRiZmEz ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K25</a>. No light can be seen through the great window.<br><br><h4>Gate Towers</h4>Each outer gate tower has an ironbound door with a built-in lock.<br><br>Characters who enter a gate tower find themselves on a flagstone floor with a hollow tower stretching high above them. The mechanisms for raising and lowering the drawbridge and portcullis fill both gate towers. The latch mechanism in each tower is magically activated by a word that only Strahd knows. It can also be activated with a successful casting of <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=MGIwMTBiN2M3ODM2 ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>dispel magic</a></em> (DC 14). Neither the drawbridge nor the portcullis will move until both latches are activated.<br><br><strong>Foundry VTT Note: </strong>We have added in a optional encounter for the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MzMwNzJmNWQ5NTZh ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>green slime</a> featured in the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NDFhNjJjZDAyMGU3 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Areas of Barovia</a> handout, area J. Gates of Ravenloft.<br><br><hr><br><h3>K2. Center Court Gate</h3>Two gates, one north of the keep and one to the south, prevent easy access to what lies beyond them.<br><br><blockquote>A massive wall juts out to connect the outer walls of the castle with the keep. A twenty-foot-wide, twenty-foot-tall archway offers passage through the connecting wall but is blocked by a rusting iron portcullis.</blockquote><br>The portcullis is unlocked and can be lifted with a successful DC 15 Strength check. It can also be opened with a command word that only <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTZiYzA5N2ViNTZi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Strahd</a> and <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NGE3OWU5NGU0Zjli ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Cyrus Belview</a> (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YWUwMjk4ZDM0NDI1 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K62</a>) know. Unless the portcullis is wedged or propped open, it falls back into place once it is let go.<br><br><hr><br><h3>K3. Servants’ Courtyard</h3><blockquote>This courtyard northeast of the keep is enclosed by towering walls. A stone carriage house with hinged wooden doors stands silent in the corner where the outer walls meet. Across from the carriage house, a slender wooden door reinforced with iron bands leads into the keep.</blockquote><br>The carriage house is described in <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NTZhOGQwMTVjZmM4 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K4</a>. The wooden door, which leads to <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZmU0Yjk2NzNiY2U4 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K23</a>, is swollen and stuck in its frame. A character can shoulder open the stuck door with a successful DC 10 Strength check.<br><br><hr><br><h3>K4. Carriage House</h3>Read the following text if the characters open the carriage house doors:<br><br><blockquote>The double doors swing open to reveal a sleek, black carriage fitted with glass windows and brass lanterns.</blockquote><br><hr><br><h3>K5. Chapel Garden</h3><blockquote>At the back of the keep, behind towering buttresses and tall, boarded-up stained-glass windows, a small garden struggles to survive. Small flowers press skyward against the gloom. A pair of large iron gates blocks the way to some kind of overlook.</blockquote><br>The large iron gates squeal loudly on rusted hinges when opened. Beyond them lies <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NTZhOGQwMTVjZmM4 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K6</a>.<br><br><hr><br><h3>K6. Overlook</h3><blockquote>Dark clouds overhead drizzle constantly. A flagstone avenue passes between empty outbuildings, leading to a stone-paved overlook. The overlook has a low stone wall adorned with outward-facing gargoyle carvings.</blockquote><br>If a character peers over the balcony, read:<br><br><blockquote>A flash of lightning illuminates the dismal village of Barovia, its rooftops visible above a smothering blanket of fog one thousand feet below.</blockquote><br>If a character who has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 15 or higher peers over the wall, add:<br><br><blockquote>Underneath the platform on which you stand, about one hundred feet down, a stone construction protrudes from the cliff face. Three dirt-caked windows are set into it.</blockquote><br>The windows are so dirty as to be opaque, although a character within reach of one can scrape the dirt away and see a dusty tomb beyond (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YzI0YTFjYTVjY2Jh ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K88</a>). Characters who try to reach the windows from the overlook must descend 110 feet and move 20 feet back under the platform. This descent can’t be accomplished without the aid of magic or the use of a climber’s kit.<br><br>Anyone who falls from the overlook plummets 1,000 feet.<br><br><h4><span style=\"color: rgb( 99 , 36 , 35 )\">Fortunes of Ravenloft</span></h4>If your card reading indicates an encounter with <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTZiYzA5N2ViNTZi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Strahd</a> in this area, he is looking out over the balcony.<br></section>","img":"modules/cor-cos/journal/004_-_Chapter_4_3A_Castle_Ravenloft/003_-_Map_2_3A_Walls_of_Ravenloft/avatar.webp"}

Abandoned Cottages</h3><blockquote>As you approach this cluster of ruined cottages separated by low stone walls, you see a short stretch of dirt road that has remained intact.</blockquote><br>The cottages contain rotted furnishings and nothing of value. The walls that separate the cottages are 3 feet tall and easily scaled or circumvented.<br><hr><br><h3>U2. Ulrich Mansion</h3><blockquote>Toward the south end of the village lie the remains of a mansion built on higher ground. It has been reduced to piles of stone and rotting timber. Empty, arched windows stare at you. South of the ruin, an untamed garden runs rampant, surrounded by broken walls that are no longer able to contain it. East of the ruin, someone has erected a crude wooden fence, forming a circular yard in which several goats are penned. Surmounting the fence posts are human skulls.</blockquote><br>The ruined mansion is littered with the rotted remains of furniture and decor. The last burgomaster of Berez, Lazlo Ulrich, haunts the ruin as a <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZjE4ZDk1Y2JmOGY2 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>ghost</a></strong>. If the characters search the mansion, the ghost appears before them:<br><br><blockquote>A ghost takes shape in the fog, assuming the form of a giant of a man, his features mutilated and his entrails hanging out like frayed ropes. Despite its intimidating presence, the apparition has a cringing light in its eyes. “Why do you invade my home? Begone, I beseech you!”</blockquote><br>Strahd refuses to let Burgomaster Ulrich’s spirit find rest because of what he did to poor Marina. The ghost recounts Marina’s sad tale if prompted. Only by convincing Ulrich that Marina has been reborn in the form of <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YjY2YzRmODJjYmNl ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Ireena Kolyana</a> can the characters put the tortured spirit to rest. The ghost must see Ireena in the flesh, and it can’t travel beyond the confines of the crumbled mansion.<br><br>Ulrich’s ghost is neutral good. It attacks if threatened or if the characters begin searching the ruined mansion for treasure. If the ghost is reduced to 0 hit points, it re-forms after 24 hours. The characters receive experience points for the ghost only if they lay Ulrich’s spirit to rest, not if they defeat the ghost in combat.<br><br><h4><span style=\"color: rgb( 99 , 36 , 35 )\">Fortunes of Ravenloft</span></h4>If your card reading reveals that a treasure is hidden in Berez, Ulrich’s ghost points the characters to the treasure’s true location, saying these words as it fades away:<br><br><blockquote>“Travel west. Two hundred paces from the mansion lies a monument to my folly and the treasure you seek.”</blockquote><br>Characters who follow Ulrich’s directions end up at area U5.<br><br><h4>Cellar</h4>Buried under rubble inside the mansion is a stone staircase that leads down to an intact cellar. A single character can clear the rubble in 4 hours, and multiple characters working together can reduce the time proportionately. The cellar is a 30-foot-square room with mortared stone walls, a 10-foot-high ceiling supported by wooden beams, and a floor submerged under 3 inches of stagnant water. The cellar contains two dozen empty, rotted casks from the Wizard of Wines winery. Each cask is labeled Champagne du le Stomp.<br><br><h4>Garden</h4>The garden behind the ruined mansion has run wild. Hidden behind tall weeds and thorny vines are nude sculptures of handsome men and beautiful women, as well as carved stone benches.<br><br>Four <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=Zjk5NjFmM2FlZWQ4 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>giant poisonous snakes</a></strong> attack characters who venture more than 10 feet inside the garden.<br><br><h4>Goat Pen</h4><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YjUxYzI2NDk0ZDIz ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Baba Lysaga</a> captures goats and uses their blood in her rituals of longevity. Nine <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZjIwNDk1YzUwZGE0 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>goats</a></strong> are trapped behind this fence. Fifty human skulls are mounted on the tops of the fence posts, spaced 10 feet apart.<br><br>There is no gate in the fence, and Baba Lysaga uses her <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YjQ0NzVmM2EzMDEy ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>flying skull</a> (see area U3) to enter and leave the pen. If the characters try to set the goats free by dismantling or damaging part of the fence, the skulls atop the fence posts begin howling and continue to howl for 1 minute. The racket attracts Baba Lysaga, who arrives in her flying skull on initiative count 20 in 2 rounds. The howling skulls also attract the seven <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NTMwMDE1YjlkZGIy ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>scarecrows</a></strong> in the marsh (see “Marsh Scarecrows” in the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=OThjNDgzZDFiOTJi ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Approaching the Ruins</a> handout). Roll initiative once for all the scarecrows.<br><hr><br><h3>U3. Baba Lysaga’s Hut</h3><strong>Foundry VTT Note: </strong>The information below is also presented in <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NWY4Njg5YTFiMDU3 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Baba Lysaga's Hut</a> for ease of use.<br><br><blockquote>Someone has built a ramshackle wooden hut on the stump of what was once an enormous tree. The rotting roots of the stump thrust up from the mire like the legs of a gigantic spider.<br><br>An open doorway is visible on one side of the hut, beneath which floats the upside-down, hollowed-out skull of a giant. Flanking the hut’s doorway are two iron cages that dangle like hideous ornaments from the eaves. Scores of ravens are trapped in each one. They squawk and flutter their wings excitedly as you approach.</blockquote><br><strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YjUxYzI2NDk0ZDIz ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Baba Lysaga</a></strong> is inside her hut unless she has been drawn forth by activity elsewhere. The squawks of the birds are music to her ears, but the noise makes it impossible for her to hear anyone approaching. Only the howling of the skulls in area U2 or sounds of combat nearby are loud enough to be heard over the squawking.<br><br>Inside each cage is a <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OGU4ZWY1YzMyYTNj ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>swarm of ravens</a></strong> that fiercely attacks Baba Lysaga and her <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NTMwMDE1YjlkZGIy ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>scarecrows</a> if released. Each cage is held shut by one of Baba Lysaga’s <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=ODJiZjI0Y2ZjN2Vk ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>arcane lock</a></em> spells, and opening it requires a <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=NzgzNWMwNDZlYzNh ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>knock</a></em> spell or a successful DC 20 Strength check. A character can also pick the lock with thieves’ tools and a successful DC 20 Dexterity check.<br><br><h4>Giant Skull</h4>The upside-down skull that floats next to the hut is <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YjQ0NzVmM2EzMDEy ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Baba Lysaga's Giant Skull</a></strong>, a hill giant’s skull that Baba Lysaga has hollowed out and transformed into a vehicle. It hovers in place until Baba Lysaga commands it to fly, which she can do only while inside it. It has a flying speed of 40 feet. No one else can control the skull. A creature inside the skull has three-quarters cover against attacks made from outside the skull. The skull is big enough to hold one Medium creature.<br><br><h4>Hut Interior</h4><blockquote>The hut is fifteen feet on a side and packed with old furniture, including a wooden cot, a wicker cabinet, a slender wardrobe, a wooden table, a stool, a barrel-topped wooden chest reinforced with brass bands, and an iron tub stained with blood. In the middle of the room is a ghastly wooden crib with a small, angelic child sitting in it. All the furnishings except for the crib are bolted to the floor. Beneath the crib, green light seeps up through cracks between the rotting floorboards.</blockquote><br>The child and the crib are illusions created by Baba Lysaga using a <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=ZDM0YmExMGU1NzZm ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>programmed illusion</a></em> spell. Baba Lysaga refers to the child as “Strahd” and created the illusion out of madness, because she considers herself a protective mother.<br><br>Beneath the hut’s rotting floorboards is a 3-foot-deep cavity containing the magic, green-glowing gem that Baba Lysaga took from the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZTRkYjc1NzhiYjcz ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Wizard of Wines Winery</a>. This gem animates the hut (see “The Creeping Hut” in the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=Y2EyODU4Y2ZmNzg5 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Special Events: Chapter 10</a> handout). The floorboards can be ripped up or smashed with a successful DC 14 Strength check. Characters can also break through the floor by dealing 10 damage to it. The hut doesn’t give up the gemstone easily, however (see <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MTk5MTgyZTlmNmIx ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Baba Lysaga's Creeping Hut</a> ). If the gem is destroyed or removed from the cavity, the hut becomes incapacitated.<br><br>Baba Lysaga keeps soiled robes in the wardrobe and assorted spell components in the wicker cabinet. The tub is where she ritually bathes in blood to prevent aging (see “Gifts of Mother Night” in the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YjUxYzI2NDk0ZDIz ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Baba Lysaga</a> handout). If the characters approach the hut at an appropriate time without being noticed, they can see Baba Lysaga bathing.<br><br><h4>Treasure</h4>The wooden chest in the hut is protected by a <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=ODA4ZGM2NjUxZGU1 ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>glyph of warding</a></em> that requires a successful DC 17 Intelligence (Investigation) check to find.

Opening the lid releases four <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MzdiMjM3NTQ2Nzll ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>crawling claws</a></strong> that fight until destroyed. Also contained in the chest are various items that Baba Lysaga has taken from dead adventurers over the years:<br><br><ul><li>1,300 gp</li><li>Five 500 gp gemstones</li><li>A vial containing <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MGJhZjc4ODBiZmI5 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i><em>oil of sharpness</em></a></li><li>Two <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MTE4ZDc2ZGNkMWQ3 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i><em>spell scrolls</em></a> (<em>mass cure wounds</em> and <em>revivify</em>)</li><li>A pouch containing ten <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=OGY2OTRjYTY3ZjQz ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i><em>+1 sling bullets</em></a></li><li>A set of <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZTZlZWY0ZDBkYzYw ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i><em>pipes of haunting</em></a></li><li>A <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NzcyNzA4MTVlNWU2 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>stone of good luck</a></em></li></ul><br><h4><span style=\"color: rgb( 99 , 36 , 35 )\">Fortunes of Ravenloft</span></h4>If your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it’s in the chest with the other items.<br><hr><br><h3>U4. Churchyard</h3><blockquote>Through the fog you see the empty shell an old stone church, north of which is a cemetery of leaning gravestones enclosed by a disintegrating iron fence. Half of the cemetery has sunk into the mire.</blockquote><br>Rotted coffins and moldy bones are buried in the graveyard. Characters who explore the gutted church find the rotten remains of a pulpit and an old iron bell half immersed in the marsh, lying amid the remains of a collapsed steeple.<br><hr><h3>U5. Marina’s Monument</h3>Strahd had this monument erected after Marina’s death. The monument is hidden in the marsh, and the characters aren’t likely to find it on their own unless they scour the area thoroughly. If they lay Burgomaster Ulrich’s spirit to rest (see area U2), it points them to this location before fading away. Without Ulrich’s guidance, the characters must enter the square in which the monument is located and search that area. A character who searches the area for 10 minutes can make a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, finding the monument on a success. If the monument isn’t found, the check can be repeated after another 10 minutes of searching.<br><br>The following boxed text assumes that the characters have met <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YjY2YzRmODJjYmNl ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Ireena Kolyana</a>.

In the center of the plot is a life-sized stone monument carved in the likeness of a kneeling peasant girl clutching a rose. Although her features are gray and weatherworn, she bears a striking resemblance to Ireena Kolyana. Carved into the monument’s base is an epitaph<br></blockquote><br>The epitaph reads as follows: Marina, Taken by the Mists.<br><br><h4><span style=\"color: rgb( 99 , 36 , 35 )\">Fortunes of Ravenloft</span></h4>If your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it is hidden in a cavity underneath the monument, which can be tipped over or moved aside by someone who makes a successful DC 15 Strength check.<br><br>If the characters disturb the monument, read:<br><br><blockquote>The croaking frogs and chirping crickets fall silent, and the stench of decay grows strong. You hear the trudge of heavy footsteps through mud and water as bloated gray shapes shamble out of the fog.</blockquote><br>Seven <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MWFlYzhkNWE5NGMy ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>distended corpses</a></strong> (human) have risen from the mire west of the monument.

When a corpse is reduced to 0 hit points, it splits open, disgorging a <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NmFiMzM2ODg2ZTI3 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>swarm of poisonous snakes</a></strong>. The snakes are hungry and fight until slain.<br><br>Characters can take the treasure and flee, easily outpacing the snake-swollen corpses.<br><hr><br><h3>U6. Standing Stones</h3><blockquote>A dozen moss-covered menhirs form a near-perfect circle in the spongy earth. These weathered stones range in height from 15 to 18 feet. A couple of them lean inward as if to share some great secret with their inscrutable neighbors. A wary-looking peasant woman lurks behind the tallest stone, a rusty lantern clutched in one gnarled hand and a dagger clutched in the other.</blockquote><br>The woman is Muriel Vinshaw, a <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NzBhNmIwNTcxN2Y0 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>wereraven</a></strong> and friend of the Martikov family (see chapters 5, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=N2VhNzc0NDhlZmVi ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Blue Water Inn</a>, and 12, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZTRkYjc1NzhiYjcz ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Wizard of Wines Winery</a>). A resident of Vallaki, Muriel spies on Baba Lysaga for her fellow wereravens. However, she avoids the village proper, preferring to lurk on the outskirts. If the characters allow her to speak, Muriel warns them about the dangers of Berez and arms them with the following information:<br><br><ul><li>Berez was abandoned long ago after the river rose and flooded the village.</li><li>An ancient and powerful hag named Baba Lysaga lives in a hut in the middle of the village. When not in her hut, Baba Lysaga flies around in a giant skull.</li><li>The scarecrows of Berez are murderous creatures under the hag’s control. They surround Baba Lysaga’s hut and serve as an early warning system.</li><li>Baba Lysaga periodically sends her scarecrows to attack the Wizard of Wines, a winery and vineyard west of Berez. She’s made enemies of the Martikov family, which owns and operates the winery and vineyard.</li><li>The hag has trapped several mountain goats in a pen near the ruins of an old mansion. (Muriel assumes that Baba Lysaga feeds on these animals.)</li></ul>Muriel avoids combat and flees if attacked. She conceals her lycanthropic nature for as long as possible, and she doesn’t willingly identify other wereravens with whom she’s acquainted. She can’t be persuaded to accompany the characters if they decide to confront Baba Lysaga. However, Muriel knows Barovia well enough to point out other nearby locations that might interest the adventurers, including the ruined mansion of <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=OGZkMWVkZjExOTc5 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Argynvostholt</a> (see chapter 7) and the ancient burial ground known as <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZWI2YTFiNTM4ZWFk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Yester Hill</a> (see chapter 14). Muriel grew up hearing stories about the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YTdmMjgwYzBiMTA2 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>druids</a> of Yester Hill, specifically how they turned away from their ancient beliefs to worship the devil Strahd. Muriel knows that the druids visit the circle of standing stones from time to time, and she does her best to avoid them.<br><br><h4>Circle of Standing Stones</h4>This ring of menhirs is one of the oldest structures in the Balinok Mountains—older than the Amber Temple, and much older than Castle Ravenloft and the various Barovian settlements scattered throughout the valley. The menhirs were raised by the same ancient folk who carved the megaliths near Old Bonegrinder (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MDYyMDU5ZmM4Y2I1 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>see chapter 6</a>). Characters who have seen those megaliths can, with a successful DC 10 Intelligence check, discern rudimentary similarities between those stones and the menhirs arranged here.<br><br>The circle is 100 feet across, and the menhirs are spaced apart at regular intervals. The stones located to the north, west, south, and east are taller than the other eight stones, which have weatherworn glyphs carved into them that represent different animals. Characters who inspect the smaller menhirs can discern the following animal shapes carved into them: bear, elk, hawk, goat, owl, panther, raven, and wolf.<br><br>The standing stones are nonmagical. However, druid characters who enter the circle can sense that powerful gods once blessed this site, and that it still holds some measure of power. They can also sense one of its properties, namely that creatures within the circle can’t be targeted by any divination magic or perceived through magical scrying sensors.<br><br>The circle has another property that druid characters can’t sense but might discover when they use the Wild Shape feature within the circle’s confines. Any druid that uses the Wild Shape feature within the circle gains the maximum number of hit points available to the new form. For example, a druid character using the Wild Shape feature to assume the form of a giant eagle would have 44 (4d10 + 4) hit points while in that form.<br><br>At your discretion, the circle might have other strange properties that have been forgotten over time. Although she knows something of the circle’s history, Muriel is unaware of its properties.<br></section>","img":"modules/cor-cos/journal/010_-_Chapter_10_3A_The_Ruins_of_Berez/002_-_Areas_of_Berez/avatar.webp"}

Wine Cellar</h3><blockquote>The stone steps descend twenty feet to a cellar that contains ten barrels of wine and an L-shaped wooden rack packed with wine bottles.</blockquote><br>The barrels in the center of the room are empty. The wine names are emblazoned on the barrels, as is the winery’s name: the Wizard of Wines. The barrels against the east wall contain Purple Grapemash No. 3, a cheap wine. The four barrels against the south wall contain Red Dragon Crush, a fine wine.<br><br>The wine racks contain thirty-three bottles of Purple Grapemash No. 3 and twenty-four bottles of Red Dragon Crush.<br><br><h4>Treasure</h4>Among the wine bottles on the rack is one with no stopper and a label that reads “Champagne du le Stomp.” It contains a rolled-up <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MTE4ZDc2ZGNkMWQ3 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>spell scroll</a> of</em><em> <a href=\"https://5e.tools/spells.html#heroes'%20feast_phb\">heroes’ feast</a></em>.<br><hr><br><h3>S17. Loft and Belfry</h3>Anyone on the curtain wall (area S18) who listens at this room’s door hear the soft tones of a stringed instrument.<br><br><blockquote>The wooden stairs climb twenty feet to a loft with a pitched roof and a door in the center of the south wall. Unlit lanterns hang from the rafters, and a rope dangles from a bronze bell lodged in the belfry thirty feet overhead. The room is filled with the sound of beautiful music—a melody so enchanting that it adds a bit of much-needed warmth to the otherwise freezing room.<br><br>A black shroud covers a humanoid shape lying on a wooden table. The music does nothing to stir it.<br><br>A cot heaped with furs rests in the northeast corner, surrounded by empty wine bottles. An oil lamp burns atop a table nearby, silhouetting a squat creature that has two heads. It sits on the edge of the cot with a viol between its legs. With a crustacean, clawlike appendage, it grasps the neck of the instrument while running a bow gently across its strings with its human hand.</blockquote><br>This loft is where the Abbot creates his flesh golems. Needles, thread, saws, and other tools lie on a small table in the northwest corner.<br><br>If anyone rings the bell, a cacophony erupts from the courtyard and the east wing as the mongrelfolk cry out, “Food!” The cries last until the creatures are fed.<br><br><strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTRkM2MwNGVjZGVk ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Clovin Belview</a></strong>, the Abbot’s manservant, a two-headed neutral evil <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTgwYWMxZDZhZTMx ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>mongrelfolk</a></strong>, resides here. He plays the viol beautifully when he is drunk, and the music help puts his half-formed head to sleep. Hidden under the furs of his cot are three bottles of Purple Grapemash No. 3. Several empty wine bottles are strewn about the floor around the cot.<br><br><h4>Roleplaying Clovin</h4>Clovin stands 4 feet, 7 inches tall and has a barrel-like shape. His right head is fully formed and combines the features of a patchy-haired man with those of a goat, complete with stubby horns. His left head is about half normal size and has a soft, cherubic face partly covered with crocodilian hide. Clovin has a crab’s pincer in place of his left hand and a bear’s paw where his right foot should be. He wears an ill-fitting monk’s robe with a belt made of hempen rope.<br><br>Clovin is the Abbot’s faithful martinet, but he is despised by the other mongrelfolk, who accuse him of hoarding food and slowly starving them to death. He would let them starve, but the Abbot has forbidden it.<br><br>Clovin has the Two-Headed feature. His madness is embodied in the following statement: “Being drunk keeps me sane.” He is drunk most of the time, but not to the extent that it impedes his combat ability, and his musical performance improves when he is inebriated.<br><br>The larger head does all the talking. The smaller head has a forked snake’s tongue and can’t do anything except hiss and make other horrible sounds.<br><br><h4>Teleport Destination</h4>Characters who teleport to this location from <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YzI0YTFjYTVjY2Jh ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K78</a> in Castle Ravenloft arrive at the point marked T on the map.<br><br><h4>Thing on the Table</h4>If the characters lift the black shroud covering the larger table, read:<br><br><blockquote>Beneath the shroud lies a creature made of stitched-together body parts. You recognize some of these parts as your own!</blockquote><br>The creature on the table appears to be made from the body parts of the characters, which, of course, cannot be. Strahd’s will is playing a trick on them. If a character touches the horrid creature, its true appearance is revealed:<br><br><blockquote>Your eyes play tricks, for what truly lies atop the table are chopped-up body parts, all of them taken from cold, gray, lifeless women, all of them waiting to be stitched together into something horrid.</blockquote><br>The body parts were plundered from graves in <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=OWRkMTE5ZDk1Mjg2 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Krezk</a>.

They wear tattered chain shirts and carry spears with rusty heads. The courtyard below is blanketed with fog.</blockquote><br>The scarecrows are lashed to wooden stands. Though fearsome from a distance, they have no life to them.<br><br>It’s a 15-foot drop from the top of the wall to the courtyard. Any creature that falls over the southwest wall tumbles 400 feet down the cliffside.<br><hr><br><h3>S19. Barracks</h3><blockquote>Bunk beds that have disintegrated with age lie in heaps along the walls of this moldy, thirty-foot-square room.</blockquote>Long ago, the abbey employed guards to defend its walls, and they were quartered here.<br><br><h4>Ezmerelda d’Avenir</h4>If the characters have not already encountered her elsewhere, the vampire hunter <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTFlNDZhMzkxNDAy ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Ezmerelda d’Avenir</a></strong> is here, plotting her next move.<br><br>Ezmerelda crept into Krezk unseen under cover of darkness and made her way to the abbey, in the hope of gaining knowledge about Strahd and his domain from the residents there. Having met the Abbot and Strahd’s “bride” (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MmIyZjFmYmJlZDZj ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area S13</a>), Ezmerelda realizes the Abbot is insane. The Abbot told her that he is expecting Strahd to visit his bride-to-be. Ezmerelda has decided to wait for the vampire to come, so that she can destroy him away from Castle Ravenloft, far from his resting place. She is planning to create a magic circle in this room as an added precaution.<br><br>As the Abbot’s guest, Ezmerelda is free to come and go as she pleases. If the characters seem committed to fighting Strahd, she abandons her plan and offers to join forces with them.<br><hr><br><h3>S20. Upstairs Office</h3><blockquote>A wooden counter shaped like an L stands at the front of this spacious office. All the other furniture has rotted away, leaving heaps of moldy wood and faded cloth.</blockquote><br>The wood of the counter is old, soft, and easily broken. Nothing of value remains here. If the characters haven’t already cleared out the madhouse (area S15), they can hear the whoops, laughter, and screams of the mongrelfolk below. The clamor continues as they explore areas S21–S24 to the east.<br><hr id=\"userscript-horizontalrule\"><br><h3>S21. Haunted Hospital</h3><blockquote>This spacious chamber contains bed frames of wrought iron arranged in two neat rows. Cobwebs and bits of rotten mattress cling to each frame.<br><br>Three doors are spaced along the south wall, each with a plaque mounted on it. From west to east, the plaques read OPERATING ROOM, NURSERY, and MORGUE.</blockquote><br>Six <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZWZkNWI3YTE5NmE4 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>shadows</a></strong> haunt this room. They are the remnants of dark souls that perished here long ago.

The shadows can’t leave this room.<br><br><hr><br><h3>S22. Operating Room</h3><blockquote>A bloodstained table stands in the middle of this otherwise empty room.</blockquote><br>The first time a character touches the table, read:<br><br><br><blockquote>A scream fills the room—a scream that echoes through time.

The screams fade until they are nothing more than haunting memories.</blockquote><br>There is nothing of value here.<br><br><hr><br><h3>S23. Nursery</h3><blockquote>This room contains the wreckage of old wooden cribs.</blockquote><br>If the characters search the room, one of them (determined randomly) sees a figure reflected in the window glass: a nun in white robes, standing in the doorway. A look back toward the door reveals nothing there, and the reflection can’t be seen again.<br><br><h4><span style=\"color: rgb( 99 , 36 , 35 )\">Fortunes of Ravenloft</span></h4>If your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it is under the wreckage of one of the cribs.<br><br><hr><br><h3>S24.

A character can also pick the lock with thieves’ tools and a successful DC 20 Dexterity check.<br><br><h4>Giant Skull</h4>The upside-down skull that floats next to the hut is a hill giant’s skull that Baba Lysaga has hollowed out and transformed into a vehicle. It hovers in place until Baba Lysaga commands it to fly, which she can do only while inside it. It has a flying speed of 40 feet. No one else can control the skull. A creature inside the skull has three-quarters cover against attacks made from outside the skull. The skull is big enough to hold one Medium creature. It has AC 15, 50 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.<br><br><h4>Hut Interior</h4><blockquote>The hut is fifteen feet on a side and packed with old furniture, including a wooden cot, a wicker cabinet, a slender wardrobe, a wooden table, a stool, a barrel-topped wooden chest reinforced with brass bands, and an iron tub stained with blood. In the middle of the room is a ghastly wooden crib with a small, angelic child sitting in it. All the furnishings except for the crib are bolted to the floor. Beneath the crib, green light seeps up through cracks between the rotting floorboards.</blockquote><br>The child and the crib are illusions created by <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YjUxYzI2NDk0ZDIz ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Baba Lysaga</a> using a <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=ZDM0YmExMGU1NzZm ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>programmed illusion</a></em> spell. Baba Lysaga refers to the child as “Strahd” and created the illusion out of madness, because she considers herself a protective mother.<br><br>Beneath the hut’s rotting floorboards is a 3-foot-deep cavity containing the magic, green-glowing gem that Baba Lysaga took from the Wizard of the Wines winery. This gem animates the hut (see “The Creeping Hut” in the “<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=Y2EyODU4Y2ZmNzg5 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Special Events: Chapter 10</a>” handout). The floorboards can be ripped up or smashed with a successful DC 14 Strength check. Characters can also break through the floor by dealing 10 damage to it. The hut doesn’t give up the gemstone easily, however (see “<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MTk5MTgyZTlmNmIx ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Baba Lysaga's Creeping Hut</a>”). If the gem is destroyed or removed from the cavity, the hut becomes incapacitated.<br><br>Baba Lysaga keeps soiled robes in the wardrobe and assorted spell components in the wicker cabinet. The tub is where she ritually bathes in blood to prevent aging (see “Gifts of Mother Night” in the “<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YjUxYzI2NDk0ZDIz ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Baba Lysaga</a>” handout). If the characters approach the hut at an appropriate time without being noticed, they can see Baba Lysaga bathing.<br><br><h4>Treasure</h4>The wooden chest in the hut is protected by a <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=ODA4ZGM2NjUxZGU1 ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>glyph of warding</a></em> that requires a successful DC 17 Intelligence (Investigation) check to find.

Opening the lid releases four <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MzdiMjM3NTQ2Nzll ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>crawling claws</a></strong> that fight until destroyed.

The password to suppress it is “Etherna.” A character can push open the doors with a successful DC 25 Strength check. The doors (AC 15, 60 hit points) can also be smashed.

Central Catacombs</h3>These catacombs contain the moldy remains of the wizards who once defended the Amber Temple. Later generations of wizards who were corrupted by the evil of the temple smashed the amber sheaths covering the dead wizards’ bodies and stole everything of value, leaving the formerly preserved corpses to rot.<br><br><blockquote>You smell the horrid perfume of the ancient dead. Stone niches along the walls of these catacombs hold human-shaped amber husks, bones, and tattered shrouds.</blockquote><br>If the characters enter these catacombs, add:<br><br><blockquote>Tall, iron candlesticks stand in alcoves.

Zhudun’s gift is the power to raise the ancient dead. As an action, the beneficiary of this dark gift can touch the remains of a dead creature and restore it to life. The effect is identical to that of the <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=M2UwMWJkZGQ5OWIy ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>resurrection</a></em> spell, except that it works regardless of how long the creature has been dead.

For example, a wizard who finds an eldritch secret in a dead archmage’s spellbook might be infused with the magic of a charm, as might a character who solves a sphinx’s riddle or drinks from a magic fountain.

Compared to <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NDM2ZTc2NDNmODQw ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Barovians</a>, they are flamboyant. Vistani dress in bright clothes, laugh often, and drink heartily. As much as they feel at home in Strahd’s dreary land, they know they can leave it whenever they please and aren’t damned to spend eternity there.<br><br>Vistani are silversmiths, coppersmiths, haberdashers, cooks, weavers, musicians, entertainers, storytellers, toolmakers, and horse traders. They also earn money by telling fortunes and selling information. They spend whatever they earn to support a lavish lifestyle, display their wealth openly as a sign of prosperity, and share their good fortune with family and friends.<br><br>Each family or clan of Vistani is its own little gerontocracy, with the oldest member ruling the roost. This elder carries the bulk of the responsibility for enforcing traditions, settling disputes, setting the course for the group’s travels, and preserving the Vistani way of life. Vistani elders make all the important decisions, but whether by choice or because of their age, tend to speak in cryptic, flowing riddles.<br><br>Vistani families and clans are closely knit. They resolve disagreements through contests that end with reconciliatory singing, dancing, and storytelling. Although they can seem lazy and irresponsible to outsiders, the Vistani are serious people, quick to act when their lives or traditions are threatened. They are merciless when they believe they must be. Vistani who knowingly bring harm or misfortune to others of their kind are banished—the worst punishment a Vistana can imagine, even worse than death.<br><br><h3>Strahd’s Vistani Servants</h3>During one of Strahd’s military campaigns, years before he became a vampire, a group of Vistani rescued him after he was wounded in battle. These Vistani not only nursed Strahd back to health but also delivered him safely home. As a reward for their generosity, Strahd declared that all Vistani had the right to come and go from his land as they please, and this privilege extends to the present day. Thus, Vistani can travel freely through the fog that surrounds Barovia, without fear of harm or entrapment.<br><br>Strahd honors his debt to the Vistani in part because he envies the Vistani way of life—the freedom they have to go where they please, their devotion to family, and their festive spirit. The courtesy he shows them is not simply a matter of honor but is also born from his admiration of them.<br><br>In the centuries since Strahd became a vampire, many Vistani have allowed themselves to be corrupted by Strahd, to the extent that they consider him their king. Vistani who serve Strahd are less lively and friendly than normal Vistani, and their hearts are poisoned with dark intentions. Strahd uses them to lure adventurers into his domain and keep him informed about the events occurring in lands beyond his reach. These Vistani will lie to protect the vampire, and they fear the consequences of disobeying him.<br><br>When it comes to sharing information about their dark master, Strahd’s Vistani pretend to be helpful, but the information they impart is misleading at best and often deceptive. They readily tell adventurers that they have a potion that protects them from the deadly fog that surrounds Barovia. Although this is a lie, they attempt to sell their fake potion for as much money as they can get.<br><br><h3>Vistani Lore</h3>Vistani know or believe certain facts about their people and their surroundings. This common lore is summarized here. Characters can learn this information after earning a Vistana’s trust.<br><br><h4>Strahd von Zarovich</h4>About Strahd, the Vistani believe the following:<br><br><ul><li>Strahd comes from a royal bloodline. He died centuries ago yet endures as one of the undead, feasting on the blood of the living. Barovians refer to him as “the devil Strahd.”</li><li>Strahd has taken many consorts, but he has known only one true love: a Barovian peasant girl named Tatyana. (The Vistani don’t know what happened to her.)</li><li>Strahd named his castle, Ravenloft, after his beloved mother, Queen Ravenovia. Strangers aren’t welcome at the castle without an invitation.</li></ul><br><h4>The Land of Barovia</h4>Vistani know the following facts about Barovia and Barovians:<br><br><ul><li>Strahd conquered this land centuries ago and named it after his father, King Barov. Strahd uses wolves, bats, and other creatures to spy on all of his realm.</li><li>Barovians are simple, frightened people. Some have old souls, but many do not. The soulless ones are easy to spot, for they know nothing but fear. They have no charm, hope, or spark, and they don’t cry.</li><li>The Old Svalich Road passes through Strahd’s domain. Three settlements lie on the road like beads on a string: Krezk to the west, Vallaki in the heart of the valley, and Barovia to the east. Strahd has spies in each settlement.</li><li>There’s an old windmill on the road between the village of Barovia and the town of Vallaki. It should be avoided at all costs! (The Vistani refuse to say more.)</li><li>It is wise to stick to the road. Wild druids, wayward ghosts, and packs of wolves and werewolves haunt the Svalich Woods.</li></ul><br><h4>Beliefs and Superstitions</h4>The Vistani have deep-rooted beliefs and superstitions that they pass down from one generation to the next:<br><br><ul><li>The souls of those who die in Barovia can’t escape to the afterlife. They are prisoners in Strahd’s domain.</li><li>Some Vistani women are blessed with prescience. Of all the great Vistani fortune-tellers, none compares to Madam Eva. If knowledge of the future is what you seek, Madam Eva will tell you your fate.</li><li>A prescient Vistana can’t see her own future or the future of another Vistana. It is the burden of the Vistani’s great gift that their own fates can’t be divined.</li><li>Vistani curses are potent, but they are invoked with great caution. Vistani know that to curse one who is undeserving of such punishment can have grave consequences for the one who utters such a curse.</li><li>Ravens carry lost souls within them, so killing one is bad luck. (The ravens don’t carry souls within.)</li></ul><br><h3>Vistani Curses</h3>A Vistana, regardless of age, can use an action to utter a curse. The curse targets another creature within 30 feet that the Vistana can see. The Vistana can’t utter another such curse before finishing a long rest.<br><br>The curse is a repayment for an injustice or a slight. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw to avoid the curse. The saving throw DC is 8 + the Vistana’s proficiency bonus + the Vistana’s Charisma modifier. The curse lasts until ended with a <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=Yzg0NGFmODc4NDdl ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>remove curse</a></em> spell, a <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=NWE2NjRlYWZmMGVm ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>greater restoration</a></em> spell, or similar magic. It doesn’t end when the target dies. If a cursed target is returned to life, the curse remains in effect.<br><br>When the curse ends, the Vistana suffers a harmful psychic backlash. The amount of this psychic damage depends on the severity of the curse that was invoked.<br><br>The Vistana chooses the curse’s effect from the options that follow; other Vistani curses are possible. All such effects deal psychic damage to the Vistani who uttered them when they end:<br><br><ul><li>The target is unable to perform a certain kind of act involving fine motor control, such as tying knots, writing, playing an instrument, sewing, or casting spells that have somatic components. When this curse ends, the Vistana takes 1d6 psychic damage.</li><li>The target’s appearance changes in a sinister yet purely cosmetic way. For example, the curse can place a scar on the target’s face, turn the target’s teeth into yellow fangs, or give the target bad breath. When this curse ends, the Vistana it takes 1d6 psychic damage.</li><li>A nonmagical item in the target’s possession (chosen by the DM) disappears and can’t be found until the curse ends. The lost item can weigh no more than 1 pound. When this curse ends, the Vistana takes 1d6 psychic damage.</li><li>The target gains vulnerability to a damage type of the Vistana’s choice. When this curse ends, the Vistana takes 3d6 psychic damage.</li><li>The target has disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws tied to one ability score of the Vistana’s choice. When this curse ends, the Vistana takes 3d6 psychic damage.</li><li>The target’s attunement to one magic item (chosen by the DM) ends, and the target can’t attune to the chosen item until the curse ends. When this curse ends, the Vistana takes 5d6 psychic damage.</li><li>The target is blinded, deafened, or both. When this curse ends, the Vistana takes 5d6 psychic damage.</li></ul><br><h3>Evil Eye</h3>As an action, a Vistana can target a creature within 10 feet that the Vistana can see. This magical ability, which the Vistani call the Evil Eye, duplicates the duration and effect of the <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=ZTllM2M0NGE3MGQ4 ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>animal friendship</a></em>, <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=OGQwNjMwY2Q3OTY0 ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>charm person</a></em>, or <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=OTlkODUxN2FiNzdm ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>hold person</a></em> spell (Vistana’s choice), but requires neither somatic nor material components. The spell save DC is 8 + the caster’s proficiency bonus + the caster’s Charisma modifier. If the target succeeds on the save, the Vistana is blinded until the end of the Vistana’s next turn.<br><br>A Vistana who uses Evil Eye can’t use it again before finishing a short or long rest. Once a target succeeds on a saving throw against a Vistana’s Evil Eye, it is immune to the Evil Eye of all Vistani for 24 hours.<br></section>","img":"modules/cor-cos/journal/002_-_Chapter_2_3A_The_Lands_of_Barovia/004_-_Vistani/avatar.webp"}

Characters who interrogate captured werewolves can learn the den’s location.

The rift began when another werewolf, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZjY1N2ZhZTg1OTUz ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Emil Toranescu</a>, questioned the treatment of children kidnapped by the pack.<br><br>Kiril would arm the children with weapons and force them to fight each other to the death until only one child was left standing. The winner would then be turned into a werewolf, ensuring what Kiril called “the strength and purity of the pack.” Emil advocated keeping all the children alive and turning them into werewolves, thus increasing the pack’s size. Emil believed that a larger pack would ensure the werewolves’ survival, whereas Kiril saw a larger pack as too difficult to control and feed.<br><br>This ideological divide couldn’t be reconciled and led to many disagreements. The other werewolves were split between the two camps, and it seemed likely that either Kiril or Emil would die before the conflict could be resolved.<br><br>Then Kiril disappeared for several days, causing the other werewolves to wonder whether he had fled or had been quietly disposed of by Emil and his allies. When Kiril returned, he was accompanied by a pack of several dozen <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=Y2U1NjM4N2M0ZDgw ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>dire </a><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MWM2Nzc5NjRiZTQy ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>wolves</a> loyal to Strahd, and he brought word from Castle Ravenloft that Strahd was not pleased with Emil’s attempt to fracture the pack. The dire wolves took Emil back to Castle Ravenloft to face punishment, and he was never seen again.<br><br>Kiril reestablished his dominance, but his ideas and tactics didn’t sit well with the pack’s older members, and they certainly didn’t please Emil’s mate, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NGQ5YzRmZWIxZjhl ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Zuleika Toranescu</a>. She knows she can’t slay Kiril on her own, and after what happened to Emil, the rest of the pack is unwilling to challenge Kiril’s authority and face Strahd’s wrath. Kiril won’t let Zuleika hunt, so she’s more or less confined to the den.<br><br><blockquote>The wolves began to howl. They knew me.

Within their walls, they grow trees that provide ample wood to keep them warm on cold nights, and they draw water from a blessed pool.

Even at this distance, you can smell the odors of wine and horses that emanate from this central area.</blockquote><br>This natural clearing serves as a permanent campsite for the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NzAzZjc4MGFjNWZk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Vistani</a> and their dusk elf allies.<br><br><h4>Roleplaying the Vistani and the Elves</h4>Use the following information to roleplay the Vistani and the dusk elves that occupy the camp.<br><br>\n<strong><em>Vistani.</em></strong> The Vistani in this camp all serve Strahd. The elders have died, leaving a pair of brothers named <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MjEzNzQzNGRmZTQ3 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Luvash</a> and <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OTExMDZkOWQ1MzRh ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Arrigal</a> in charge. Both men are evil and willing to do whatever Strahd demands of them.<br><br>\nThese Vistani have two problems. First, Luvash’s seven-year-old daughter, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=M2FlYmU3MWJiYzdl ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Arabelle</a>, recently disappeared from the camp. Consequently, half of the Vistani are out searching for her when the characters arrive. Second, the Vistani have exhausted their supply of wine and are eager to obtain more. Characters who help them with either problem earn the Vistani’s respect.<br><br>\n<strong><em>Dusk Elves. </em></strong>The dusk elf race is all but forgotten, and the few survivors live in secret places such as this. They have dark skin and hair, but otherwise they are similar to wood elves (as described in the <em>Player’s Handbook</em>). One of Strahd’s old brides, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NjcyNWRkZmY0YzFi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Patrina Velikovna</a>, used to live here. Her brother, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OGY5ODNiNzk2MzI4 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Kasimir Velikov</a>, still does.<br><br>\nThe dusk elves reside in small homes built into the hillside and are mostly self-sufficient. They are skilled trackers, and many of them are away from camp when the characters arrive, helping the Vistani search for <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=M2FlYmU3MWJiYzdl ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Arabelle</a>. Strahd has tasked the Vistani with keeping an eye on the dusk elves, and the dusk elves know they aren’t safe in Barovia without the Vistani’s “protection.” Strahd has also forbidden the Vistani from helping the dusk elves escape his domain.<br><br>There are no women or children among the dusk elves. Strahd had all the female dusk elves put to death around four centuries ago as a punishment for Patrina’s murder. Thus, the remaining elves can’t procreate. A broken people, they are aware of the vampire’s absolute hold over the land of Barovia. They keep a low profile and have no desire to incur Strahd’s wrath again.<br><br><hr><br><h3>N9a. Kasimir's Hovel</h3>If the characters approach the house at the base of the hill on the eastern perimeter of the camp, read the following text:<br><br><blockquote>Standing quietly in front of this house, bathed in the warm light of its lanterns, are three sullen, gray-cloaked figures, their angular features and black, flowing hair half-hidden under their cowls.</blockquote><br>The cloaked figures are three <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ODRmNDExZDdlMjM0 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>dusk elf guards</a></strong> (N male). If the characters seem friendly and are looking for someone to talk to, the guards direct them inside to Kasimir or point them toward the Vistani camp on the hilltop.<br><br><strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OGY5ODNiNzk2MzI4 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Kasimir Velikov</a> </strong>is the leader of the dusk elves. His hovel has a decorated vestibule and a comfortable room beyond with a fireplace. Wooden statuettes of elven deities stand in cubbyholes along one wall. A tapestry of a forest hangs on the opposite wall.<br><br>\nKasimir confesses that he is burdened by dreams sent to him by his dead sister, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NjcyNWRkZmY0YzFi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Patrina Velikovna</a>, whose spirit has languished in the catacombs below Castle Ravenloft for centuries. Kasimir believes that Patrina has repented for her many sins, and he yearns not only to free her but also to restore her to life.<br><br>\nIf the characters seem intent on destroying Strahd, Kasimir tells them about the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NjAxOTQ4MWE0MmMy ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Amber Temple</a>. Without divulging too much of the dreams sent to him by Patrina, Kasimir informs the characters that the secret to breaking Strahd’s pact and freeing Barovia from its curse might be hidden there. Kasimir doesn’t know whether this claim is true or not, but he states it as a way of persuading the characters to accompany him to the temple; his main objective, he says, is to find something there that he can use to bring Patrina back from the dead.<br><br>\n<strong><em>Treasure. </em></strong>Kasimir wears a <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MTZjODVlMDllYWZm  style=\"font-style: italic\"><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>ring of warmth</a><span style=\"font-style: italic\">&nbsp;</span>and has a leather-bound spellbook containing all the spells he has prepared plus the following spells: <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=ODJiZjI0Y2ZjN2Vk ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>arcane lock</a></em>, <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=NWUxNWFkNWVjNzcy ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>comprehend languages</a></em>, <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=OTlkODUxN2FiNzdm ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>hold person</a></em>, <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=ZTE2YmJjZDliYTYw ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>identify</a></em>, <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=ZjNlNzYwMDc2ZDg1 ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>locate object</a></em>, <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=Yjc0Mjc0MjA2OTI2 ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>nondetection</a></em>, <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=MmNmOGU0ZTQ1NjM3 ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>polymorph</a></em>, <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=YTlkY2MxYTdkMDlh ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>protection from evil and good</a></em>, <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=Y2JkNzIzOGJjMjQw ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>ray of frost</a></em>, and <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=MDQxYTFkNmE5NmQ4 ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>wall of stone</a></em>.<br><br><h4><span style=\"color: rgb( 99 , 36 , 35 )\">Fortunes of Ravenloft</span></h4><span style=\"color: rgb( 99 , 36 , 35 )\"></span>\nIf your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it is in Kasimir’s possession. He relinquishes it if the characters promise to accompany him to the Amber Temple and help him find a way to bring his sister Patrina back from the dead.<br><br><hr><br><h3>N9b. Dusk Elf Hovels</h3>\nSix simple houses ring the base of the hill, three protruding from the north side and three from the south side.<br><br><blockquote>A grim, gray-cloaked figure stands in front of the door to this house.</blockquote><br>The cloaked figure is a <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ODRmNDExZDdlMjM0 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>dusk elf guard</a></strong> (N male). If the characters appear friendly and are looking for someone to talk to, the guard directs them to Kasimir’s hovel (area N9a). Under no circumstances does the guard willingly allow strangers to enter the house he protects.<br><br>\nEach hovel is configured similarly to Kasimir’s hovel. All are currently unoccupied. (Except for the nine guards left behind to watch the homes, the dusk elves are out searching for Arabelle.)<br><br><hr><br><h3>N9c. Vistani Tent</h3>The two men in studded leather armor are the leaders of the Vistani camp—the brothers <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MjEzNzQzNGRmZTQ3 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Luvash</a></strong> (CE male human) and <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OTExMDZkOWQ1MzRh ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Arrigal</a></strong> (NE male human). If you used the “<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=N2I4YzYxOGRmZmI2 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Plea for Help</a>” adventure hook, the characters have already met Arrigal. Luvash is so drunk that he has disadvantage on his attack rolls and ability checks. Each brother carries a key that unlocks one of the padlocks of the treasure wagon (area N9i).<br><br>\nLuvash is punishing a Vistana named <strong>Alexei</strong> (CN male human <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OGYwMTAyODRiNTg3 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Vistana bandit</a> </strong>with 3 hit points remaining) for failing to keep a watchful eye on his daughter. The characters’ arrival distracts Luvash, and he forgets about Alexei long enough to play the role of host—until such time as the characters become tiresome or threatening. Alexei blames himself for not watching the little brat more closely and has accepted his punishment. If the characters try to rescue him, he screams at them to stop, not wanting to appear weak in front of Luvash and Arrigal.<br><br>\nIn addition to Luvash, Arrigal, and Alexei, there are six intoxicated Vistani (CN male and female human<strong> <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OGYwMTAyODRiNTg3 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Vistani bandits</a></strong>) lying unconscious in the tent. A drunk Vistana awakens only if the Vistana takes 5 damage or more and has at least 1 hit point remaining afterward.<br><br>\n<strong><em>Dealing with Luvash. </em></strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MjEzNzQzNGRmZTQ3 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Luvash</a> is unhappy because his seven-year-old daughter, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=M2FlYmU3MWJiYzdl ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Arabelle</a>, has vanished. She’s been gone for a little more than a day. Because everyone in the camp was drunk and <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OTExMDZkOWQ1MzRh ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Arrigal</a> was away, no one remembers seeing or hearing anything strange. Luvash is determined to find her, no matter what the cost, and most of his camp is out scouring the woods when the characters arrive. (Missing from the camp are twelve<strong> <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OGYwMTAyODRiNTg3 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Vistani bandits</a></strong>. Each hour that passes, 1d4 of them return to camp with no news on Arabelle’s whereabouts.)<br><br>\nIf an alarm is sounded, nine sober<strong> <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OGYwMTAyODRiNTg3 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Vistani bandits</a></strong> (NE male and female humans) emerge from three of the surrounding wagons (area N9g) and arrive at the tent with weapons drawn in 2 rounds.<br><br>\nLuvash won’t meddle in the characters’ affairs without Strahd’s consent, and he is quite content to let the vampire deal with them. For a hefty price, he offers to sell the characters potions that allow safe passage through the deadly fog that surrounds the valley; he keeps them in the treasure wagon (area N9i). The potions don’t work, of course.<br><br>\nIf the characters rescue <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=M2FlYmU3MWJiYzdl ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Arabelle</a> from Lake Zarovich (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NDFhNjJjZDAyMGU3 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Areas of Barovia, area L</a>) and see her safely returned to camp, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MjEzNzQzNGRmZTQ3 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Luvash</a> is overjoyed and offers to repay the favor. He doesn’t sell them the fake potions. (“Um, they aren’t as potent as they could be.”) Instead, he lets them choose a treasure from the Vistani treasure wagon (area N9i).<br><br>\nIf the characters ask something of the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NzAzZjc4MGFjNWZk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Vistani</a> but have not earned Luvash’s goodwill, he agrees to do business with them if they accomplish one of two tasks: either find his missing daughter or procure six barrels of wine and bring them to the camp. <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MjEzNzQzNGRmZTQ3 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Luvash</a> suggests they can get the wine in Vallaki, or go straight to the source—the Wizard of Wines winery. He isn’t picky when it comes to the quality of the wine.<br><br>\n<strong><em>Dealing with Arrigal. </em></strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OTExMDZkOWQ1MzRh ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Arrigal</a> is a much more dangerous creature than his brute of a brother. If the characters have something in their possession that is either useful or harmful to Strahd and Arrigal becomes aware of it, he tries to deprive the characters of this item, stalking them if necessary and going as far as to kill one or more of them if he thinks he can escape with the item in his possession. If he succeeds, he takes one of the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=M2EyMGQ5MWU5MjI4 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>riding horses</a> (area N9d) and delivers the item to Strahd at Castle Ravenloft.<br><br><hr><br><h3>N9d. Horses</h3><blockquote>The hilltop is covered with steaming piles of horse dung. More than two dozen horses are tethered to stone blocks inside the circle of wagons but outside the tent. Most of the animals are draft horses, but a few of them are riding horses equipped with saddles.</blockquote><br>Twenty-four <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NDVmYmY0YWQ5OTgx ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>draft horses</a></strong> and six <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=M2EyMGQ5MWU5MjI4 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>riding horses</a></strong> are tethered here.<br><br><hr><br><h3>N9e. Luvash's Wagon</h3><blockquote>This barrel-topped wagon is nicer than the others. Drapes of golden silk hang in the windows, and the wheels have gold, sun-shaped hubcaps. An iron chimney pipe protrudes from the roof.</blockquote><br>Luvash’s wagon is a mess inside. Empty wineskins, dirty clothes, and mangy furs are strewn about. A small hammock strung across the width of the wagon under the driver’s seat serves as Arabelle’s bed. A burlap doll with button eyes lies in the hammock; Arabelle has no other possessions.<br><br>\nA small iron stove in the middle of the wagon keeps the interior warm.<br><br>\n<strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> The wagon’s “golden sun” hubcaps are worth 125 gp apiece (500 gp total).<br><br><hr><br><h3>N9f. Wagon of Sleeping Vistani</h3>There are four of these wagons at the camp.<br><br><blockquote>You hear heavy snores from within this barrel-topped wagon.</blockquote><br>Each of these wagons contains 1d4 intoxicated and unconscious Vistani (CN male and female human <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OGYwMTAyODRiNTg3 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Vistani bandits</a></strong>). These Vistani wake up if their wagon is shaken or if they take damage and have at least 1 hit point remaining.<br><br><hr><br><h3>N9g. Wagon of Gambling Vistani</h3>There are three of these wagons at the camp.<br><br><blockquote>Loud voices and laughter spill from this barrel-topped wagon.</blockquote><br>Each of these wagons contains three Vistani (CN male and female human<strong> <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OGYwMTAyODRiNTg3 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Vistani bandits</a></strong>). The Vistani are playing a dice game for wine and favors, since they have no money. They respond to sounds of alarm by drawing their weapons and heading to the tent (area N9c).<br><br><hr><br><h3>N9h. Vistani Family Wagon</h3>There are three of these wagons at the camp.<br><br><blockquote>This barrel-topped wagon is filled with the raucous screams and laughter of children.</blockquote><br>Each of these wagons contains one Vistani adult (CN male or female human <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OWYxMjNkNjFkMTdj ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>commoner</a></strong>) and 1d4 + 1 Vistani children (CN male and female human noncombatants). The adult is watching the children playing games, teaching the children about their heritage, or telling a scary story to frighten the children.<br><br><hr><br><h3>N9i. Vistani Treasure Wagon</h3><blockquote>Two iron padlocks secure the door of this barrel-topped wagon.</blockquote><br>The Vistani keep all their treasure in this wagon. The door to the wagon has two locks, each of which requires a different key. <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MjEzNzQzNGRmZTQ3 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Luvash</a> carries one key, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OTExMDZkOWQ1MzRh ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Arrigal</a> the other.

The town lies beyond the sight of Castle Ravenloft and doesn’t, at first blush, seem as depressed (or oppressed) as the village of Barovia farther east. Characters who spend time in Vallaki, however, quickly realize that there is no happiness here, only false hope—which Strahd himself cultivates.<br>\n<br>Vallaki was founded not long after Strahd’s armies conquered the valley by an ancestor of the town’s current burgomaster, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OGQyM2MyNTQyN2Rm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Baron Vargas Vallakovich</a>. The Vallakoviches have royal blood in their veins and have long believed themselves superior to the Zarovich line. Baron Vallakovich has deluded himself into believing that hope and happiness are the keys to Vallaki’s salvation. If he can make everyone in Vallaki happy, the burgomaster thinks that the town will somehow escape Strahd’s grasp and return to the forgotten world whence it came. He stages one festival after another to bolster the spirits of the townsfolk, but most Vallakians consider these festivals to be pointless, meaningless affairs more likely to incur Strahd’s wrath than to provide any hope for the future.<br>\n<br>In the last festival, Baron Vallakovich had townsfolk parade through the streets with the severed heads of wolves on pikes. His next event, which the burgomaster has dubbed the Festival of the Blazing Sun, is soon to get under way (see the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=N2M0MmM5ZjE3Mzdj ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Special Events: Chapter 5</a> handout). Weatherworn garlands from previous festivals still hang from the eaves of Vallaki’s buildings, and work has begun on a large wicker sun, to be set ablaze in the town square on the day of the festival. In the days leading up to the festival, Baron Vallakovich has begun arresting local malcontents and throwing them in the stocks so that his efforts aren’t ruined by “those of little hope or faith.”<br><br><blockquote>There is no light in the eyes of the men that feed off this land.

Dragon Statue</h3>\n<blockquote>Perched atop a ten-foot-wide, ten-foot-high cube of granite is a moss-covered statue of a dragon, its wings tucked close to its body. The statue looks east, toward the mansion.</blockquote>\n<br />The fog makes it hard to see the dragon&rsquo;s features from a distance, but close inspection reveals that it&rsquo;s a silver dragon of noble bearing, its spiny frill cracked and broken in many places. The statue is 10 feet tall but looks much more imposing perched on the granite block.<br /><br />If scrutinized with a <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"ZGFkZjk1MTVlNDI3\">detect magic</a></em> spell, the statue radiates an aura of evocation magic. The dragon statue used to breathe a cone of cold as part of a magic trap, but the trap no longer works (see area Q2).<br /><br />Reveal <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"MjUxZWI5NDNhOTBl\">Handout: Dragon Statue</a> to players.<br /><br /><hr /><br />\n<h3>Q2. Main Entrance</h3>\n<blockquote>Flagstone steps flanked by stone railings climb to a landing in front of a pair of tall, wooden doors with rusted iron bands and knockers shaped like small dragons. Carved into the lintel above the entrance is the word Argynvostholt.</blockquote>\n<br />If a creature climbs the steps or sets foot on the landing, the dragon statue (area Q1) opens its mouth and exhales a 60-foot cone of harmless cold air, then closes its mouth and doesn&rsquo;t activate again until the next dawn. At one time, the statue would breathe a cone of ice and hail, but its magic has deteriorated over the years.<br /><br />The doors are unlocked and can be pushed open to reveal a dark foyer (area Q3).<br /><br /><hr /><br />\n<h3>Q3. Dragon's Foyer</h3>\n<blockquote>This room feels like a king&rsquo;s tomb. A grand staircase leads up to stone balconies held aloft by stone pillars and arches. A tall, faded tapestry depicting a nobleman in silver armor hangs from an iron rod above the staircase landing.<br /><br />Six sets of double doors lead from this foyer. Along the walls, displayed on marble pedestals, are three alabaster busts of handsome men. A fourth bust and its pedestal have been knocked over, and their shattered remains lie strewn across the mosaic floor. Two chandeliers of wrought iron hang from the ceiling like monstrous black spiders.</blockquote>\n<br />The tapestry is torn in places and worthless. It is a portrait of Lord Argynvost. The alabaster busts depict several of the dragon&rsquo;s other human guises. The stairs lead up to the second-floor balconies (area Q18).<br /><br />\n<h4>Shadow of Argynvost</h4>\nThe first time the characters pass through this foyer, read: <br /><br />\n<blockquote>A great shadow with wings moves across the walls and disappears. You hear the soft bestial hiss in the darkness.</blockquote>\n<br />The draconic shadow is ominous yet harmless.<br /><br /><hr /><br />\n<h3>Q4. Spiders' Ballroom</h3>\n<blockquote>Rubble is strewn throughout much of this vast chamber, caused by the partial collapse of the rooms above it. On the pink marble floor, fallen chandeliers lie amid broken chairs and other furnishings. Thick webs stretch from wall to wall, and moving among them are too many giant spiders to count!</blockquote>\n<br />Nine <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"YzYzMzhjZmFkMjU4\">giant spiders</a></strong> nest here. They attack anyone who gets too close.<br /><br /><hr /><br />\n<h3>Q5. Ruined Stable</h3>\n<blockquote>Here lie the blackened beams of a wooden stable, burned to its stone foundation. Looming above the wreckage is the partially collapsed south end of the mansion, all three of its floors exposed to the elements.</blockquote>\n<br />There is nothing of value in the stable.<br /><br /><hr /><br />\n<h3>Q6. Dragon's Den</h3>\n<blockquote>This wood-paneled den has been ransacked, its furnishings tossed about. A cold, dark hearth dominates the west wall between two narrow windows. Standing upright against the north wall is a sarcophagus made of black wood with a queen&rsquo;s effigy carved into its lid.</blockquote>\n<br />Argynvost had the empty sarcophagus converted into a wine cabinet. Now, only shattered wineglasses and decanters are to be found on the shelves. The den&rsquo;s other furnishings include rotted divans, broken chairs, overturned ottomans, and smashed oil lamps.<br /><br />A secret door at the north end of the east wall can be pushed open to reveal a storage room (area Q11).<br /><br />\n<h4>Living Fire</h4>\nIf the beacon of Argynvostholt (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"YjBhMmJmNDI2NGQy\">area Q53</a>) has not been lit, read the following text when the characters approach the fireplace for the first time:<br /><br />\n<blockquote>A fire erupts in the dead hearth and assumes a draconic form. It hisses, crackles, and unfurls its smoky wings.</blockquote>\n<br />Have the player characters roll initiative. The fire acts on initiative count 10 and has AC 15, 1 hit point, and immunity to fire, poison, and psychic damage. If it is reduced to 0 hit points, it explodes and fills the room with fire, setting fire to the dry furnishings. Each creature in the room must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.<br /><br />The fire doesn&rsquo;t attack. On its first turn, if it has not been reduced to 0 hit points, it speaks:<br /><br />\n<blockquote>The fiery dragon hisses as it addresses you. &ldquo;My knights have fallen into darkness. Save them if you can. Show them the light they have lost!&rdquo; With that, the fire burns out.</blockquote>\n<br />The dragon refers to the Order of the Silver Dragon and the beacon (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"YjBhMmJmNDI2NGQy\">area Q53</a>).<br /><br /><hr /><br />\n<h3>Q7. Parlor</h3>\n<blockquote>Tattered velvet drapes cover the tall, slender windows that encircle this parlor. The furnishings are covered with dust and cobwebs, and lie in disarray. A damaged brass chandelier hangs from the ceiling, which is covered with a faded mural that depicts metallic dragons and colorful birds flying beneath white clouds.</blockquote>\n<br />Time and neglect have damaged the furnishings, leaving nothing of value.<br /><br /><hr /><br />\n<h3>Q8. Iron Gate</h3>\nAn iron gate, chained shut, closes off a 10-foot-tall archway on the north wall of the mansion. The key to the chain&rsquo;s padlock was lost long ago, but the lock can be picked by someone who uses thieves&rsquo; tools and makes a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. The old lock can be smashed by a character who uses a bludgeoning or slashing weapon on it and makes a successful DC 15 Strength check.<br /><br />Ten-foot-high flights of stone steps to the west and east of the archway lead up to landings and doors that provide access to areas Q7 and Q9.<br /><br /><hr /><br />\n<h3>Q9. Servants' Quarters</h3>\n<blockquote>Tattered brown drapes cover the windows of this circular room, and a heavy curtain hangs across an archway to the south. Strewn about the floor is the wreckage of half a dozen beds and other pieces of furniture.</blockquote>\n<br />Lord Argynvost&rsquo;s household staff once slept here. The room contains nothing of value. Beyond the curtain lies the kitchen (area Q10).<br /><br /><hr /><br />\n<h3>Q10. Kitchen</h3>\n<blockquote>This kitchen has been plundered, its tables overturned. The floor is littered with rusted utensils and smashed crockery. Narrow windows flanking a hearth look out over a cemetery. An open iron pot hangs from a hook inside the blackened fireplace. It rattles on its hook and bobs up and down, as though something is inside it.</blockquote>\n<br />The iron pot contains an ordinary <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"Y2U2NDMxYmRhYTIy\">bat</a></strong>. When the characters get close, it flies out and flaps about the room.<br /><br /><hr /><br />\n<h3>Q11. Wine Storage</h3>\n<blockquote>Five barrels lie in wooden braces along the walls of this dark, moldy storage room.</blockquote>\n<br />Hiding behind the barrels is a wounded elf named <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"YjYzMDdjNDY5ZDcz\">Savid</a></strong> (N male dusk elf). He has 4 hit points remaining and is grateful for any healing the characters can provide.<br /><br />Savid lives with the other dusk elves of Barovia in the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"ODllODk5YTg3YTEx\">Vistani camp</a> outside Vallaki. He was searching the woods for a missing Vistani girl named <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"M2FlYmU3MWJiYzdl\">Arabelle</a> when a wandering mob of <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"N2Q4MGZmNDkzYzMy\">needle blights</a> accosted him. He was forced to take refuge in the mansion.<br /><br />Savid, who is more than four hundred years old, volunteers the following useful information:<br /><br />\n<ul>\n<li>Argynvost was a silver dragon that liked to assume human forms. Argynvostholt was the dragon&rsquo;s home.</li>\n<li>In human guise, the noble dragon led a group of knights called the Order of the Silver Dragon. They gave shelter to refugees who had come to the valley to escape Strahd&rsquo;s army. Strahd&rsquo;s soldiers slew the dragon, destroyed the order, and sacked the mansion.</li>\n<li>Vistani and dusk elves avoid the mansion, believing that the dragon&rsquo;s ghost haunts it.</li>\n</ul>\nThe wine in the barrels turned to vinegar and evaporated long ago. Emblazoned on the barrels&rsquo; sides are the name of the winery, the Wizard of Wines, and the name of the wine, Champagne du le Stomp.<br /><br />A secret door at the north end of the west wall can be pulled open to reveal a den (area Q6).<br /><br /><hr /><br />\n<h3>Q12. Dining Hall</h3>\n<blockquote>A twenty-foot-long table with sculpted dragons for legs stands in the center of this hall. The chairs that surround the table have backs carved to resemble folded dragon wings, and several of the chairs have been overturned or smashed to pieces. Suspended above the table is a crystal chandelier that glows with a soft white light. Standing in windowed alcoves are two life-sized statues depicting knights with dragon-winged helms and shields.<br /><br />Rainwater trickles through cracks in the ceiling, flowing down the west wall and adding to a large puddle on the floor.<br /><br />Five sets of wooden doors lead to this hall. The doors in the northeast corner hang open. A pair of leaded glass doors, their panes cracked and broken, stand open between panels of stained glass set into the east wall. These panels depict silver dragons in flight. Beyond the glass doors lies a dark, misty room that appears to be a chapel.</blockquote>\n<br />A <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"ZWZmZjdkNzM5ZmU4\">continual light</a> </em>spell was cast on the crystal chandelier long ago and has never been dispelled. The knight statues are lifelike but inanimate.<br /><br /><hr /><br />\n<h3>Q13. Chapel of Morning</h3>\n<blockquote>Cracked wooden pillars support a wooden, U-shaped balcony that overhangs this stone-walled chapel. Narrow archways lead to spiral staircases that curl up to the balcony, and a door set into the north wall has a wooden beam barring it. At the east end of the chapel rests a stone altar flanked by iron candelabras. The altar is carved with a rising sun bas-relief. Tall, arching windows set with panels of stained glass decorate the walls behind the altar. One of the windows has been shattered, covering the chapel floor with shards of colored glass and allowing thick fog to enter and fill the room.</blockquote>\n<br />If the beacon has not been lit (see areas Q16 and <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"YjBhMmJmNDI2NGQy\">Q53</a>), add:<br /><br />\n<blockquote>Through the fog, you see three armored figures kneeling before the altar.</blockquote>\n<br />The figures are three <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"YjFkODEyZDQyYjAx\">revenants with longswords</a></strong> clad in tattered chain mail that affords the same protection as leather armor. Each revenant wields a longsword. If the beacon is lit, the revenants are cleansed of their hatred and laid to rest, and the characters find three armored corpses with longswords lying on the floor in front of the altar. The revenants, if still active, are blinded by their hate and attack the characters on sight, seeking to drive them out of Argynvostholt.<br /><br />Characters who study the room&rsquo;s iconography and orientation (the fact that it draws light from the east) can determine, with a successful DC 10 Intelligence (Religion) check, that the chapel is dedicated to a god of the dawn. Anyone familiar with Barovian religion can conclude that the god in question is the Morninglord.<br /><br />The balcony (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"ZmJhY2Q0N2E0MTgz\">area Q24</a>) is 20 feet high and can be reached by climbing either spiral staircase (area Q14).<br /><br />Characters who stand near the altar and look up can see the hollow interior of the beacon tower. The tower&rsquo;s lower landing (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"YjBhMmJmNDI2NGQy\">area Q50</a>) is 60 feet above the chapel floor, and the upper landing (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"YjBhMmJmNDI2NGQy\">area Q51</a>) is another 20 feet above that.<br /><br />The bar across the north door is easily lifted from this side. Once the bar is removed, the door can be pulled open to reveal a stone staircase leading down to a cemetery (area Q15).<br /><br /><hr /><br />\n<h3>Q14. Chapel Staircases</h3>\n<blockquote>Narrow windows allow dim light to enter this five-foot-wide spiral staircase.</blockquote>\n<br />The staircase leads from the chapel (area Q13) to the chapel&rsquo;s balcony (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"ZmJhY2Q0N2E0MTgz\">area Q24</a>) and climbs another 20 feet to a small, empty room with a window that looks down on the chapel.<br /><br /><strong>WORLD BUILDER NOTE :</strong> A tower trigger the teleport to the empty room that look down the chapel. This tower is visible for your player.<br /><br /><hr /><br />\n<h3>Q15. Cemetery</h3>\n<blockquote>Tucked behind the mansion is a fog-shrouded cemetery enclosed by a seven-foot-tall fence of wrought iron. In the northeast corner stands a mausoleum.</blockquote>\n<br />If the beacon has not been lit (see areas <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"ZmJhY2Q0N2E0MTgz\">Q16</a> and <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"YjBhMmJmNDI2NGQy\">Q53</a>), read the following text when the characters cross the cemetery for the first time:<br /><br />\n<blockquote>You suddenly feel like someone or something is watching you. Looking up, you spot a well-dressed man with a thick mane of thistledown hair observing you from a high tower window. He draws the curtain and disappears from view.</blockquote>\n<br />The strange man watches the characters through the southeast window of <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"MmM3OGViZjlhNDM3\">area Q42</a>. He is merely an apparition intended to lure the characters to that room.<br /><br />The mausoleum is described in area Q16.<br /><br />The thick fog obscures the fact that five of the graves have been dug up. Closer inspection and a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals that the corpses buried there crawled out of the earth. Of the missing corpses there is no sign, but the surrounding fence is intact, which suggests that no one got into the cemetery from outside. (These corpses were animated by the spirits of <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"ODIxNTQ5NTg2YmNk\">revenants</a> and clawed their way out.)<br /><br />A stone staircase curls up the outside of a turret to a flagstone landing in front of a sturdy wooden door. The door is barred from the inside and opens into the chapel (area Q13).<br /><br /><hr /><br />\n<h3>Q16. Dragon's Mausoleum</h3>\n<blockquote>Tarnished, silver-plated gargoyles shaped like dragon wyrmlings cling to the stone-tiled roof of this mausoleum. An eight-foot-tall, four-foot-wide white marble door set into the southwest wall is engraved with a name: Argynvost.</blockquote>\n<br />The dragon-shaped gargoyles are harmless statuary. The stone door can be pulled open with a successful DC 15 Strength check.<br /><br />\n<blockquote>The interior of the mausoleum is dark and dusty. You see four empty alcoves with raised floors. Etched into the far wall is a verse written in Draconic.</blockquote>\n<br />Characters who can read the Draconic script can decipher the writing on the wall (reveal <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"YTA3NjcwYjlkNDg5\">Handout: Dragon's Mausoleum</a>):<br /><br />\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Here lie the bones and treasures of<br />Argynvost, lord of Argynvostholt and<br />founder of the Order of the Silver Dragon.<br /><br /></em></div>\n<h4>Development</h4>\nIf the skull of Argynvost is brought from Castle Ravenloft (see chapter 4, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"YWUwMjk4ZDM0NDI1\">area K67</a>) and sealed inside the mausoleum, the dragon&rsquo;s spirit transforms into a brilliant light at the top of the tower (see <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"YjBhMmJmNDI2NGQy\">area Q53</a>).</section>","img":"modules/cor-cos/journal/007_-_Chapter_7_3A_Argynvostholt/003_-_Argynvostholt_Ground_Floor/avatar.webp"}

It was being run by a friend I had known in high school, John Scott Clegg, and it was typical of the type of adventure that people played in those days. It was all about exploring a hodgepodge collection of rooms connected by dungeon corridors, beating up the monsters that we encountered, searching for treasure, and gaining experience points.<br><br>Now we were face to face with random encounter number thirty-four: a vampire. Not a Vampire with a capital V, but a so-many-Hit-Dice-with-such-and-such-an-Armor-Class lowercase vampire. Just another monster in the dungeon.<br><br>I remember thinking at the time, What are you doing here? This creature seemed completely out of place with the kobolds, orcs, and gelatinous cubes we had seen thus far. This was a creature who deserved his own setting and to be so much more than just a wandering monster. When I came home from that game, I told all these thoughts to Laura.<br><br>That was when <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTZiYzA5N2ViNTZi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i></a>Strahd von Zarovich was born.<br><br>Strahd would be no afterthought—he demanded his own setting, his own tragic history. Laura and I launched into researching the mythology and folklore surrounding the vampire. We started with the vague, black-and-white image of Bela Lugosi in 1931, but found so much more.<br><br>The first “modern” literary foundation of the vampire was penned by John William Polidori based on a fragment of a story by Lord Byron. It was while at the Villa Diodati—a rented house next to Lake Geneva, Switzerland—that Byron and Polidori met Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin and her husband-to-be, Percy Shelley. One night in June, Byron suggested that they each write a ghost story. Mary Shelley’s contribution to the effort would later become <em>Frankenstein</em>. The short story “The Vampyre,” published in 1819, was Polidori’s contribution. He was Byron’s personal physician, and the first of the so-called “romantic” vampires under Polidori’s hand was actually modeled after Lord Byron.<br><br>Byron—like the fictional vampires that he inspired, from Polidori’s Lord Ruthven down through the penultimate work of Bram Stoker—was a decadent predator, an abuser hidden behind a romantic veil. He was a comely and alluring monster—but a monster nevertheless. The romantic vampire of the earliest years of the genre was not just a spouse abuser but a spouse killer, the archetype of abuse in the worst kind of destructive codependency.<br><br>For Laura and me, those were the elements that truly defined Strahd von Zarovich—a selfish beast forever lurking behind a mask of tragic romance, the illusion of redemption that was ever only camouflage for his prey.<br><br>Initially we were going to title the adventure Vampyr—one of a series of games we called Nightventure that Laura and I were self-publishing back in 1978. The castle was called Ravenloft, and when Halloween came around each year, our friends asked us if we could play “that Ravenloft game” again … and so the better title won out. It was, in part, because of this design that I was hired by TSR, Inc., to write Dungeons &amp; Dragons adventures in 1982. Soon thereafter, I6 <em>Ravenloft</em> was published.<br><br>Since then, fans of <em>Ravenloft</em> have seen many different creative perspectives on Barovia (a country which, by absolute coincidence, is featured in a 1947 Bob Hope movie called <em>Where There’s Life</em>). It continues to be one of the most popular Dungeons &amp; Dragons adventures of all time. In its various incarnations, each designer has endeavored to bring something new to the ancient legend of Strahd, and to each of them we are grateful.<br><br>But the vampire genre has taken a turn from its roots in recent years. The vampire we so often see today exemplifies the polar opposite of the original archetype: the lie that it’s okay to enter into a romance with an abusive monster because if you love it enough, it will change.<br><br>When Laura and I got a call from Christopher Perkins about revisiting <em>Ravenloft</em>, we hoped we could bring the message of the vampire folktale back to its original cautionary roots. The talented team at Wizards of the Coast not only graciously took our suggestions but engaged us in a dialogue that delivered new insights on the nightmare beyond the gates of Barovia.<br><br>Now we invite you again as our guests to pass through the Svalich Woods if you dare. For here the romance is tragically dangerous … and a true monster smiles at your approach.<br><br>Tracy Hickman<br>May 2015<br></section>","img":"modules/cor-cos/journal/000_-_START_HERE/007_-_Foreword_3A_Ravenloft_Revisited/avatar.webp"}

Similarly, in a campaign where a spaceship has crashed or elements of modern-day Earth are present, futuristic or modern firearms might appear. The Firearms table provides examples of firearms from all three of those periods. The modern and futuristic items are priceless.<br><br><h3>Proficiency</h3>It’s up to you to decide whether a character has proficiency with a firearm. Characters in most D&amp;D worlds wouldn’t have such proficiency. During their downtime, characters can use the training rules in the <em>Player’s Handbook</em> to acquire proficiency, assuming that they have enough ammunition to keep the weapons working while mastering their use.<br><br><h3>Properties</h3>Firearms use special ammunition, and some of them have the burst fire or reload property.<br><br><strong><em>Ammunition.</em></strong> The ammunition of a firearm is destroyed upon use. Renaissance and modern firearms use bullets. Futuristic firearms are powered by a special type of ammunition called energy cells. An energy cell contains enough power for all the shots its firearm can make.<br><br><strong><em>Burst Fire.</em></strong> A weapon that has the burst fire property can make a normal single-target attack, or it can spray a 10-foot-cube area within normal range with shots. Each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take the weapon’s normal damage. This action uses ten pieces of ammunition.<br><br><strong><em>Reload.</em></strong> A limited number of shots can be made with a weapon that has the reload property. A character must then reload it using an action or a bonus action (the character’s choice).<br><br><h5>Firearms</h5><table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n<strong>Renaissance Item</strong>\n</td><td valign=\"top\">\n<strong>Cost</strong>\n</td><td valign=\"top\">\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n<p><strong>Damage</strong>\n</p></td><td valign=\"top\">\n<strong>Weight</strong>\n</td><td valign=\"top\">\n<strong>Properties</strong>\n</td></tr><tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n<em>Martial Ranged Weapons</em>\n</td><td valign=\"top\">\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n<p>Pistol\n</p></td><td valign=\"top\">\n250 gp\n</td><td valign=\"top\">\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n<p>1d10 piercing\n</p></td><td valign=\"top\">\n3 lb.\n</td><td valign=\"top\">\nAmmunition (range 30/90), loading\n</td></tr><tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\nMusket\n</td><td valign=\"top\">\n500 gp\n</td><td valign=\"top\">\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n<p>1d12 piercing\n</p></td><td valign=\"top\">\n10 lb.\n</td><td valign=\"top\">\nAmmunition (range 40/120), loading, two-handed\n</td></tr><tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n<em>Ammunition</em>\n</td><td valign=\"top\">\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n<p>Bullets (10)\n</p></td><td valign=\"top\">\n3 gp\n</td><td valign=\"top\">\n\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n<p>—\n</p></td><td valign=\"top\">\n2 lb.\n</td><td valign=\"top\">\n— </td></tr></tbody></table></section>","img":""}

Dungeon Level Access</h3>The wooden spiral staircase from the attic ends here. A narrow tunnel stretches southward before branching east and west.<br><br><h4>Ghostly Chanting</h4>From the moment they arrive in the dungeon, the characters can hear an eerie, incessant chant echoing throughout. It’s impossible to gauge where the sound is coming from until the characters reach area 26 or 29. They can’t discern its words until they reach area 35.<br><hr><br><h3>23. Family Crypts</h3>Several crypts have been hewn from the earth. Each crypt is sealed with a stone slab unless noted otherwise. Removing a slab from its fitting requires a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check; using a crowbar or the like grants advantage on the check.<br><br><h4>23A. Empty Crypt</h4>The blank stone slab meant to seal this crypt leans against a nearby wall. The crypt is empty.<br><br><h4>23B. Walter’s Crypt</h4>The stone slab meant to seal this crypt leans against a nearby wall. Etched into it is the name Walter Durst. The crypt is empty.<br><br><h4>23C. Gustav’s Crypt</h4>The stone slab is etched with the name Gustav Durst. The chamber beyond contains an empty coffin atop a stone bier.<br><br><h4>23D. Elisabeth’s Crypt</h4>The stone slab is etched with the name Elisabeth Durst. The crypt contains a stone bier with an empty coffin atop it. A <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YTZhMGJlNDM3YzZm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>swarm of centipedes</a></strong> boils out of the back wall and attacks if the coffin is disturbed.<br><br><h4>23E.

Cult Initiates’ Quarters</h3>A wooden table and four chairs stand at the east end of this room. To the west are four alcoves containing moldy straw pallets.<br><hr><br><h3>25. Well and Cultist Quarters</h3>A 4-foot-diameter well shaft with a 3-foot-high stone lip descends 30 feet to a water-filled cistern. A wooden bucket hangs from a rope-and-pulley mechanism bolted to the crossbeams above the well.<br><br>Five side rooms once served as quarters for senior cultists. Each contains a wood-framed bed with a moldy straw mattress and a wooden chest to hold personal belongings. Each chest is secured with a rusty iron padlock that can be picked with thieves’ tools and a successful DC 15 Dexterity check.<br><br><h4>Treasure</h4>In addition to some worthless personal effects, each chest contains one or more valuable items.<br><br><strong>25A.</strong> This room’s chest contains 11 gp and 60 sp in a pouch made of human skin.<br><strong>25B.</strong> This room’s chest contains three moss agates (worth 10 gp each) in a folded piece of black cloth.<br><strong>25C.</strong> This room’s chest contains a black leather eyepatch with a carnelian (worth 50 gp) sewn into it.<br><strong>25D.</strong> This room’s chest contains an ivory hairbrush with silver bristles (worth 25 gp).<br><strong>25E.</strong> This room’s chest contains a silvered shortsword (worth 110 gp).<br><hr><br><h3>26. Hidden Spiked Pit</h3>The ghostly chanting heard throughout the dungeon gets discernibly louder as one heads west along this tunnel. A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals an absence of footprints. Characters searching the floor for traps find a 5-foot-long, 10-foot-deep pit hidden under several rotted wooden planks, all hidden under a thin layer of dirt. The pit has sharpened wooden spikes at the bottom. The first character to step on the cover falls through, landing prone and taking 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage from the fall plus 11 (2d10) piercing damage from the spikes.<br><hr><br><h3>27. Dining Hall</h3>This room contains a plain wooden table flanked by long benches. Moldy humanoid bones lie strewn on the dirt floor—the remains of the cult’s vile banquets.<br><br>In the middle of the south wall is a darkened alcove (area 28). Characters who approach within 5 feet of the alcove provoke the creature that lurks there.<br><hr><br><h3>28. Larder</h3>This alcove contains a <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NTcxYzA2YjE2MGIz ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>grick</a></strong> that slithers out to attack the first character it sees within 5 feet of it. Any character with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score under 12 is surprised by it. The alcove is otherwise empty.<br><hr><br><h3>29. Ghoulish Encounter</h3>The ghostly chanting heard throughout the dungeon is noticeably louder to the north. When one or more characters reach the midpoint of the four-way tunnel intersection, four <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZjEwNjY5MTM3YjE2 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>ghouls</a></strong> (former cultists) rise up out of the ground and attack. The ghouls fight until destroyed.<br><hr><br><h3>30. Stairs Down</h3>It’s obvious to any character standing at the top of this 20-foot-long staircase that the ghostly chants originate from somewhere below. Characters who descend the stairs and follow the hall beyond arrive in area 35.<br><hr><br><h3>31. Darklord’s Shrine</h3><blockquote>This room is festooned with moldy skeletons that hang from rusty shackles against the walls. A wide alcove in the south wall contains a painted wooden statue carved in the likeness of a gaunt, pale-faced man wearing a voluminous black cloak, his pale left hand resting on the head of a wolf that stands next to him. In his right hand, he holds a smoky-gray crystal orb.<br><br>The room has exits in the west and north walls. Chanting can be heard coming from the west.</blockquote><br>The statue depicts <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTZiYzA5N2ViNTZi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Strahd</a>, to whom the cultists made sacrifices in the vain hope that he might reveal his darkest secrets to them. If the characters touch the statue or take the crystal orb from Strahd’s hand, five <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZWZkNWI3YTE5NmE4 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>shadows</a></strong> form around the statue and attack them. The shadows (the spirits of former cultists) pursue those who flee beyond the room’s confines.<br><br>The skeletons on the wall are harmless decor.<br><br><h4>Concealed Door</h4>Characters searching the room for secret doors find a concealed door in the middle of the east wall with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check. It’s basically an ordinary (albeit rotted) wooden door hidden under a layer of clay. The door pulls open to reveal a stone staircase that climbs 10 feet to a landing (area 32).<br><br><h4>Treasure</h4>The crystal orb is worth 25 gp. It can be used as an arcane focus but is not magical.<br><hr><br><h3>32. Hidden Trapdoor</h3>The staircase ends at a landing with a 6-foot-high ceiling of close-fitting planks with a wooden trapdoor set into it. The trapdoor is bolted shut from this side and can be pushed open to reveal the den (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MGFjNmUzYzExN2M0 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area 3</a>) above.<br><br><h4>Development</h4>Once the trapdoor has been found and opened, it remains available to characters as a way into and out of the dungeon level.<br><hr><br><h3>33. Cult Leaders’ Den</h3>The door in the southwest corner is a <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZmQ5Yzg2OGFjODVi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>mimic</a></strong> in disguise. Any creature that touches the door becomes adhered to the creature, whereupon the mimic attacks. The mimic also attacks if its takes any damage.<br><br>A chandelier is suspended above a table in the middle of the room. Two high-backed chairs flank the table, which has an empty clay jug and two clay flagons atop it. Iron candlesticks stand in two corners, their candles long since melted away.<br><hr><br><h3>34. Cult Leaders’ Quarters</h3>This room contains a large wood-framed bed with a rotted feather mattress, a wardrobe containing several old robes, a pair of iron candlesticks, and an open crate containing thirty torches and a leather sack with fifteen candles inside it. At the foot of the bed is an unlocked wooden footlocker containing some gear and magic items (see “Treasure” below).<br><br>Two <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MjNiYWVmNjEzOTc4 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>ghasts</a></strong> (Gustav and Elisabeth Durst) are hidden in cavities behind the earthen walls, marked X on the map; they burst forth and attack if someone removes one or more items from the footlocker. The ghasts wear tattered black robes.<br><br><h4>Treasure</h4>Characters searching the footlocker find a folded <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=Mjg1M2I5NmYwYzQ4 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i><em>cloak of protection</em></a>, a small wooden coffer (unlocked) containing four <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NDBhYzNmNWNmZDNl ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i><em>potions of healing</em></a>, a chain shirt, a mess kit, a flask of alchemist’s fire, a bullseye lantern, a set of thieves’ tools, and a spellbook with a yellow leather cover containing the following wizard spells:<br><br>1st level: <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=YTQ2ZjBkMWRlZjc1 ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>disguise self</a>, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=ZTE2YmJjZDliYTYw ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>identify</a>, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=OWNmNWVhNDBjMTc3 ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>mage armor</a>, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=NTBkMDE5OWQxZWQz ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>magic missile</a>, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=YTlkY2MxYTdkMDlh ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>protection from evil and good</a></em><br>2nd level: <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=ZTk2NzNjOTFiMmQ5 ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>darkvision</a>, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=OTlkODUxN2FiNzdm ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>hold person</a>, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=MmU0MTk4MmMxMTI3 ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>invisibility</a>, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=Zjc5ODA0N2E2MmIx ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>magic weapon</a></em><br><br>These items were taken from adventurers who were drawn into Barovia, captured, and killed by the cult.<br><hr style=\"font-style: italic\"><h3>35. Reliquary</h3>The ghostly chant emanating from area 38 fills this room. Characters can discern a dozen or so voices saying, over and over, “He is the Ancient. He is the Land.”<br><br>The cult amassed several “relics” that it used in its rituals. These worthless items are stored in thirteen niches along the walls:<br><br><ul><li>A small, mummified, yellow hand with sharp claws (a goblin’s hand) on a loop of rope</li><li>A knife carved from a human bone</li><li>A dagger with a rat’s skull set into the pommel</li><li>An 8-inch-diameter varnished orb made from a nothic’s eye</li><li>An aspergillum carved from bone</li><li>A folded cloak made from stitched ghoul skin</li><li>A desiccated frog lashed to a stick (could be mistaken for a <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NDYwZDdiOWUxMzQx ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>wand of polymorph</a></em>)</li><li>A bag full of bat guano</li><li>A hag’s severed finger</li><li>A 6-inch-tall wooden figurine of a mummy, its arms crossed over its chest</li><li>An iron pendant adorned with a devil’s face</li><li>The shrunken, shriveled head of a halfling</li><li>A small wooden coffer containing a dire wolf’s withered tongue</li></ul>The southernmost tunnel slopes down at a 20-degree angle into murky water and ends at a rusty portcullis (area 37).<br><hr><br><h3>36. Prison</h3>The cultists shackled prisoners to the back walls of alcoves here. The prisoners are long gone (their bones litter the floor in area 27), but the rusty shackles remain.<br><br><h4>Secret Door</h4>A secret door in the south wall can be found with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check and pulls open to reveal area 38 beyond.<br><br><h4>Treasure</h4>Hanging on the back wall of the cell marked X on the map is a human skeleton clad in a tattered black robe. The skeleton belongs to a cult member who questioned the cult’s blind devotion to Strahd. Characters who search the skeleton find a gold ring (worth 25 gp) on one of its bony fingers.<br><hr><br><h3>37. Portcullis</h3>This tunnel is blocked by a rusty iron portcullis that can be forcibly lifted with a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check. Otherwise, the portcullis can be raised or lowered by turning a wooden wheel half-embedded in the east wall of area 38. (The wheel is beyond the reach of someone east of the portcullis.) The floor around the portcullis is submerged under 2 feet of murky water.<br><hr><br><h3>38. Ritual Chamber</h3>The cult used to perform rituals in this sunken room. The chanting heard throughout the dungeon originates here, yet when the characters arrive, the dungeon falls silent as the chanting mysteriously stops.<br><br><blockquote>The chanting stops as you peer into this forty-foot-square room. The smooth masonry walls provide excellent acoustics. Featureless stone pillars support the ceiling, and a breach in the west wall leads to a dark cave heaped with refuse. Murky water covers most of the floor. Stairs lead up to dry stone ledges that hug the walls. In the middle of the room, more stairs rise to form an octagonal dais that also rises above the water. Rusty chains with shackles dangle from the ceiling directly above a stone altar mounted on the dais. The altar is carved with hideous depictions of grasping ghouls and is stained with dry blood.</blockquote><br>The water is 2 feet deep. The ledges and central dais are 5 feet high (3 feet higher than the water’s surface), and the chamber’s ceiling is 16 feet high (11 feet above the dais and ledges). The chains dangling from the ceiling are 8 feet long; the cultists would shackle prisoners to the chains, dangle them above the altar, cut them open with knives, and allow the altar to be bathed in blood.<br><br>Half embedded in the east wall is a wooden wheel connected to hidden chains and mechanisms. A character can use an action to turn the wheel, raising or lowering the nearby portcullis (see area 37).<br><br>The hole in the west wall leads to a naturally formed alcove. The half-submerged pile of refuse that fills it is a <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YzkzNDEwOTc4NTk3 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>shambling mound</a></strong>, which the cultists dubbed Lorghoth the Decayer. It is asleep but awakens if attacked or if the characters summon the cultists but refuse to complete their ritual (see “One Must Die!” below). A character standing next to the mound can discern its true nature with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Nature) check.<br><br><h4>“One Must Die!”</h4>If any character climbs to the top of the dais, read:<br><br><blockquote>The chanting rises once more as thirteen dark apparitions appear on the ledges overlooking the room. Each one resembles a black-robed figure holding a torch, but the torch’s fire is black and seems to draw light into it. Where you’d expect to see faces are voids.<br><br>“One must die!” they chant, over and over. “One must die! One must die!”</blockquote><br>The apparitions are harmless figments that can’t be damaged, turned, or dispelled.<br><br>Characters on the dais when the cultists appear must sacrifice a creature on the altar or face the cult’s wrath; characters can ascertain what must be done with a successful DC 11 Intelligence (Religion) or Wisdom (Insight) check. To count as a sacrifice, a creature must die on the altar. The apparitions don’t care what kind of creature is sacrificed, and they aren’t fooled by illusions.<br>If the characters make the sacrifice, the cultists fade away, but their tireless chant of “He is the Ancient. He is the Land,” echoes again in the dungeon. Strahd is aware of the sacrifice, and <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MGFjNmUzYzExN2M0 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Death House</a> now does nothing to hinder the characters (see “<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ODIzOGYxMTkyMDNi ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Endings: Death House</a>” handout).<br><br>If the characters leave the dais without making the sacrifice, the cultists’ chant changes: “Lorghoth the Decayer, we awaken thee!” This chant rouses the shambling mound and prompts it to attack. It pursues prey beyond the room but won’t leave the dungeon. It can move through tunnels without squeezing and completely fills its space. At the start of the shambling mound’s first turn, the chant changes again: “The end comes! Death, be praised!” If the shambling mound dies, the chanting stops and the apparitions vanish forever.<br></section>","img":"modules/cor-cos/journal/018_-_Appendix_B_3A_Death_House/003_-_Death_House_-_Dungeon/avatar.webp"}

Wachterhaus</h2><blockquote>This house seems disgusted with itself. A slouching roof hangs heavy over furrowed gables, and moss-covered walls sag and bulge under the weight of the vegetation. As you study the house’s sullen countenance, you hear the edifice actually groan. Only then do you realize the extent to which the house hates what it has become.</blockquote><br>The Wachter family, once an influential noble line in Barovia, owns and occupies a mansion in Vallaki. The house’s reigning governess, Fiona Wachter, is a loyal servant of Strahd. She seeks to supplant Baron Vallakovich as the town burgomaster.<br><br>\n<h4>Roleplaying</h4>\nUse the following information to roleplay Lady Wachter, her family, and her associates.<br><br>\n<strong><em>Lady of the House. </em></strong><strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YjY4NzcyNWM3YWNl ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Lady Fiona Wachter</a></strong> (LE female human) makes no secret of her family’s long-standing loyalty to the von Zarovich line. She believes that Strahd von Zarovich is no tyrant but, at worst, a negligent landlord. She would happily serve Strahd as burgomaster of Vallaki, but she knows that <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OGQyM2MyNTQyN2Rm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Baron Vargas Vallakovich</a> won’t give up his birthright without a fight.<br><br>\nFiona conspired to wed her young daughter, Stella, to the baron’s son, Victor, as part of a plot to gain a foothold in the baron’s mansion, but Stella found Victor to be demented, and he showed no interest in Stella whatsoever. In fact, he spoke such unkind words to Stella that she went mad, and Fiona had to lock her daughter away (see area N4n).<br><br>\nLady Wachter’s latest scheme to gain control of Vallaki is far more diabolical. She has started a cult based on devil worship and has written a manifesto that she reads to her “book club,” which is made up of the most fanatical group members. Inspired by her words, these zealots have created smaller cults of their own. Once her cult has enough members, Fiona plans to take the town by force. To reward her most loyal followers, she has her pet imp stand invisibly in the center of a pentagram, then performs a false ritual that calls upon “princes of darkness” to lavish their appreciation upon the cultists. The imp then sprinkles onto the floor a few electrum coins, which Lady Wachter allows the cultists to keep.<br><br>\nAnother secret of Fiona’s is that she sleeps with the corpse of her dead husband, Nikolai, who died of sickness nearly three years ago and whom Fiona cherished. Lady Wachter casts <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=NGM2M2ZiNGZiNGYw ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>gentle repose</a></em> spells on the corpse to keep it from deteriorating.<br><br>\nIf the characters come to Wachterhaus looking for help to overthrow the burgomaster, Lady Wachter is all ears and suggests they start by killing the baron’s evil henchman, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OWI0OGEwMDg5M2Qy ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Izek Strazni</a>. She’s happy to take care of the rest. If they come looking for a way to defeat Strahd, Lady Wachter turns them away, stating in no uncertain terms that she is not, nor ever will be, Strahd’s enemy.<br><br>\n<strong><em>Fiona’s Sons.</em></strong> Fiona sees a lot of her husband in her sons, Nikolai Wachter and Karl (N male human <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NTQ0NTQyYjBjN2Vl ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>nobles</a></strong>), who have grown into young men with a fondness for wine and trouble. They aren’t home during the day, because they don’t like attending to their mother or listening to her tiresome prattle. The characters might encounter them at the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=N2VhNzc0NDhlZmVi ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Blue Water Inn</a> (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=N2VhNzc0NDhlZmVi ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area N2</a>) or wandering about town. The brothers are home most nights, passed out in their beds after hours of heavy drinking.<br><br>\nNikolai and Karl have none of their mother’s ambition or mean temper. They are aware of her cult, but they don’t know that she sleeps with their dead father. This would be unwelcome news and probably turn them against their mother. They want only to spend their mother’s money and make the most of their miserable situation, trapped as they are within the walls of Vallaki under the control of Strahd and his puppet, the baron.<br><br>\n<strong><em>Fiona’s Spy. </em></strong>Fiona employs a money-grubbing <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=Y2QzMTVmNmEzYjEz ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>spy</a></strong> named Ernst Larnak (LE male human) to keep her informed about everything that happens in town. Ernst knows Lady Wachter’s secrets, and he would blackmail her in a heartbeat if their relationship went sour.<br><br><hr><br><h3>N4a. Front Door and Vestibule</h3>The front door is locked and reinforced with bronze bands. All of the servants carry a key, as do Lady Wachter and Ernst Larnak. The door can be forced open with a successful DC 20 Strength check.<br><br>\nIf the characters knock on the front door, a servant opens a small window cut into the door at eye height and asks their business. Suspicious-looking strangers aren’t invited inside, in case they’re vampires.<br><br><blockquote>The front door opens into a narrow vestibule. Three stained-glass doors in wooden frames lead from it.</blockquote><br>Two closets flank the front door. The western closet contains Lady Wachter’s outdoor clothes; the eastern one contains coats and boots that belong to her children.<br><br><hr><br><h3>N4b. Staircase</h3><blockquote>A wooden staircase leads up to a balcony. At the foot of the stairs is a landing with three stained-glass doors in wooden frames.</blockquote><br>The staircase climbs 15 feet to the upstairs hall (area N2l).<br><br><hr><br><h3>N4c. Kitchen</h3>\nThe house cook (see area N4h) rushes about this spotless kitchen most of the day, preparing meals or cleaning up after himself. A washbasin stands in the northeast corner. A slender door in the west wall leads to a small pantry.<br><br><hr><br><h3>N4d. Storage Room</h3>\nThis room holds crates of old clothing, as well as three barrels of drinking water, two empty wine barrels, and one full wine barrel. The wine barrels are emblazoned with the winery name, the Wizard of Wines, and the wine’s name, Red Dragon Crush.<br><br><hr><br><h3>N4e. Back Vestibule</h3>\nThe back door is locked and similar to the front door (area N4a) in every respect. The vestibule has plain wooden doors leading to areas N4d, N4f, and N4h.<br><br><hr><br><h3>N4f. Servants’ Closet</h3><blockquote>Servants' coats and aprons hang from hooks in this room, and boots are neatly lined up against the wall.</blockquote><br>Anyone who searches the closet and makes a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check finds a secret door in the south wall. The door can be pulled open to reveal a stone staircase (area N4g) that leads to the cellar.<br><br><hr><br><h3>N4g. Secret Staircase</h3><blockquote>Iron torch sconces cling to the wall of a stone staircase that cuts its way through the heart of the old house.</blockquote><br>The stairs connect the servants' closet (area N4f) with the cellar (area N3s). Lady Wachter uses this staircase to reach her secret cult lair (area N4t).<br><br><hr><br><h3>N4h. Servants' Quarters</h3><blockquote>The furnishings in this room are bereft of imagination: four simple beds with equally austere wooden chests.</blockquote><br>Lady Wachter’s four servants (N male and female <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OWYxMjNkNjFkMTdj ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>commoners</a></strong>) sleep here at night. They include a cook named Dhavit, two maids named Madalena and Amalthia, and a valet named Haliq. The servants know Lady Wachter’s secrets, but they would sooner die than betray her.<br><br><hr><br><h3>N4i. Parlor</h3>Lady Wachter greets her guests here, under the watchful eyes of her dead husband.<br><br><blockquote>Here three elegant couches surround an oval table made of black glass. All are set in front of a blazing hearth, above which hangs the portrait of a smirking nobleman sporting a broken nose and a tangle of hair graying at the temples. Several smaller portraits hang on the north wall.</blockquote><br>The portrait above the mantel depicts Lord <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NjQ1MGQzZGNjMzUy ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Nikolai Wachter</a>, Fiona’s late husband (of whom his sons are the spitting image). The other portraits depict Lady Wachter, her sons, her daughter, and various deceased family members.<br><br>\nThe parlor shares the fireplace with the den (area N4k). Ernst Larnak lurks in the den and eavesdrops on any conversation that Lady Wachter has with the characters, so that he can advise her after they depart.<br><br><hr><br><h3>N4j. Dining Room</h3><blockquote>An ornate dining table stretches the length of this room, a crystal chandelier hanging above it imperiously. The silverware is tarnished, the dishes chipped, yet all are still quite elegant. Eight chairs, their backs adorned with sculpted elk horns, surround the table. Arched windows made of a latticework of iron and glass look out onto the small, fog-swept estate.</blockquote><br>If the characters aim to oppose the burgomaster, Lady Wachter offers them a warm meal in the dining room as a token of her support and allegiance.<br><br><hr><br><h3>N4k. Den</h3><blockquote>Wood paneling, embroidered rugs, colorful furnishings, and a blazing fire make this chamber stifling. Mounted above the mantel is an elk’s head. Across from the hearth, tall, slender windows look out over dead gardens.</blockquote><br>Ernst Larnak, Lady Wachter’s spy, lounges here when he’s not out spying on her behalf.<br><br>\n<strong><em>Treasure. </em></strong>The room contains several items of value, including a golden goblet (worth 250 gp) from which Ernst drinks wine, a crystal wine decanter (worth 250 gp), four electrum candelabras (worth 25 gp each), and a bronze urn with frolicking children painted on its sides (worth 100 gp).<br><br><hr><br><h3>N4l. Upstairs Hall</h3><blockquote>A hallway with a window at each end wraps around the staircase railing. Framed portraits and mirrors festoon the walls, surrounding you with judging looks and dark reflections. You hear something scratching at one of the many doors.</blockquote><br>The scratching noise comes from the door to area N4n, which is locked. If the characters call out, a plaintive female voice meows like a cat and says, “Can little kitty come out to play? Little kitty is sad and lonely and promises to be good this time, really she does.” A closet at the south end of the hallway holds blankets and linens.<br><br><hr><br><h3>N4m. Brothers' Rooms</h3><blockquote>This bedroom contains nothing out of the ordinary: a neatly made bed, a table with an oil lamp on it, a handsome wooden chest, a slender wardrobe, and a window box with drapes.</blockquote><br>These two rooms belong to Lady Wachter's sons, Nikolai and Karl. There's a 25 percent chance that one of the maids (see area N4h) is here, tidying up.<br><br><hr><br><h3>N4n. Stella's Room</h3>The door to this room is locked from both sides, and only Lady Wachter has a key.<br><br><blockquote>This room is musty and dark. An iron-framed bed fitted with leather straps stands near a wall. The place has no other furnishings.<br><br>\nScurrying away from you on all fours is a young woman in a soiled nightgown. She leaps onto the bed and hisses like a cat. “Little kitty doesn’t know you!” she shouts. “Little kitty doesn’t like the smell of you!”</blockquote><br>The young woman is <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZDEwMDZkZDUwNTNj ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Stella Wachter</a></strong> (CG female human), Lady Wachter’s insane daughter. A <em>greater restoration</em> spell rids her of the madness that makes her think she’s a cat. If she is cured of her madness, she blames her mother for treating her horribly and using her as a pawn to seize control of the town. Stella knows none of her mother’s secrets, apart from her mother’s desire to overthrow the burgomaster. Stella has nothing kind to say about the burgomaster or his son, Victor, whose very name makes her cringe. With her wits restored, Stella feels she has no one in Vallaki she can count on. She latches onto any character who is kind to her. If the party takes her to St. Andral’s church (area N1), Father Lucian offers to look after her, and she agrees to stay with him.<br><br><hr><br><h3>N4o. Master Bedroom</h3>\nThe door to this room is locked. Lady Wachter and her servants carry keys. A ghastly sight awaits those who peer into the room:<br><br><blockquote>Across from the door, a fire sputters and struggles for life in the hearth, above which hangs a framed family portrait: a <span style=\"background-color: rgb( 255 , 255 , 255 )\">noble</span> father and mother, their two young sons, and a baby daughter in the father’s arms. The sons are smiling in a way that suggests mischief. The parents look like uncrowned royalty.<br><br>Wood paneling covers the walls of the room. A closet and a framed mirror flank a curtained window to the south. To the north, a wide, canopied bed lies pinned between matching end tables with oil lamps. Stretched out on one side of the bed is a man dressed in black, his eyes each covered with a copper piece. He bears a striking resemblance to the father in the painting.</blockquote><br>Lady Wachter’s husband, Nikolai, lies in his bed, impeccably dressed, quite deceased, and under the effect of the <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=NGM2M2ZiNGZiNGYw ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>gentle repose</a></em> spell. Nothing of value is on him.<br><br>\nThe closet contains shelves of fancy footwear and many fine garments, including a black ceremonial robe with a hood (similar to the ones worn by the cult fanatics in area N4t). On a high shelf rests a locked iron chest. Lady Wachter hides the key to the chest on a tiny hook in the fireplace, under the mantel. A character who takes a minute to search the fireplace finds the key with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check. Use of the key disables a <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NzRmYTIzZGNjYjZi ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>poison needle trap</a> hidden in the lock. A creature that triggers the trap and fails the saving throw against the needle’s poison falls unconscious for 1 hour instead of being poisoned for 1 hour.<br><br>\nThe iron chest is lined with thin sheets of lead and contains the bones of Leo Dilisnya, an enemy of the Wachter family. Leo was one of the soldiers who betrayed and murdered Strahd on the day of Sergei and Tatyana’s wedding. He escaped from Castle Ravenloft, only to be hunted down and killed by the vampire Strahd. The Wachters keep his bones under lock and key so that Leo can’t be raised from the dead.<br><br>\n<h4><span style=\"color: rgb( 99 , 36 , 35 )\">Fortunes of Ravenloft</span></h4>If your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it is in the iron chest that contains Leo Dilisnya’s bones.<br><br><hr><br><h3>N4p. Library</h3>\nThe double doors to this room are locked. Lady Wachter and her servants carry keys.<br><br><blockquote>This room is crawling with cats. Bookshelves hug the walls, but most of the shelves are bare. Other furnishings include a desk, a chair, a table, and a wine cabinet. The room has an irregular shape, and none of its angles seem quite right, as though the shifting of the house has set the whole place on edge.</blockquote><br>Eight <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MDQ2ZTQ4MDkyNTMy ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>cats</a></strong> have the run of the library. These family pets have vicious dispositions, attacking anyone who tries to pick them up. Characters who have a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 10 or higher notice that one cat has a small key hanging from its collar. The key opens the locked chest in area N4q.<br><br>\nThere is a 25 percent chance that one of the maids is here, dusting the bookshelves.<br><br>\nThe cabinet holds a fine collection of wineglasses. The desk contains blank pieces of parchment, quill pens, jars of ink, wax candles, and a wax seal.<br>\nMost of the Wachter family’s book collection was sold off years ago to cover debts, and the books that remain aren’t particularly valuable. Use the Random Books table (see <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZTM3NDAwZGFhNGE5 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Rooms of Weeping</a>, area K37) to determine the subject matter of a particular book.<br><br>\nA section of the bookshelf that stretches along the southernmost wall is actually a secret door on hidden hinges. The bookshelf can be pulled outward, revealing an open doorway that leads to area N4q.<br><br><hr><br><h3>N4q. Storage Room</h3>\n\n<blockquote>Behind the hinged panel in the bookcase lies a dusty, ten-foot-square room with a curtained window and shelves lining three walls. On the bottom shelf rests an iron chest. The other shelves are bare.<br></blockquote><br>The key to the chest can be found in the library (area N4p). Use of the key disables a <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NzRmYTIzZGNjYjZi ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>poison needle trap</a> hidden in the lock.<br><br>\n<strong><em>Treasure. </em></strong>The iron chest contains several items:<br><br><ul><li>A silk bag containing 180 ep, each coin bearing Strahd’s stern visage in profile</li><li>A leather bag containing 110 gp</li><li>A wooden pipe that has been passed down through many generations of Wachter patriarchs</li><li>Five scrolls—notarized deeds for parcels of land given to the Wachter family by Count Strahd von Zarovich nearly four centuries ago</li><li>A supple leather case containing an unbound manuscript titled <em>The Devil We Know</em>—a poetic manifesto written by Lady Fiona Wachter attesting that the worship of devils can bring happiness, success, freedom, wealth, and longevity</li><li>A blasphemous treatise bound in black leather titled <em>The Grimoire of the Four Quarters</em>, written by the infamous diabolist Devostas, who was drawn and quartered for his fell practices yet did not die (this is a forgery; the actual grimoire would drive a reader mad)</li><li>A very old letter to Lady Lovina Wachter (an ancestor) from one Lord Vasili von Holtz, thanking Lovina for her hospitality, loyalty, and friendship over the years</li></ul>\n\nCharacters who have the <em>Tome of Strahd </em>realize that the handwriting in Lady Lovina’s letter is identical to Strahd’s handwriting, suggesting that Strahd and Lord Vasili are one and the same.<br><br><hr><br><h3>N4r. Cellar Entrance</h3>If the characters approach the cellar door from the outside, read:<br>\n<br><blockquote>A slanted, wooden cellar door with an iron pull ring and iron hinges stands against the foundation of the house.</blockquote>\n\n<br>The door is unlocked. On the other side of the door are stone steps leading to a stone landing with a wooden railing. A longer staircase extends south from the landing, leading down to the cellar.<br><br><hr>\n<br><h3>N4s. Cellar</h3><blockquote>This large root cellar has a dirt floor. Two ascending flights of stone steps enclosed by wooden railings stand across from one another. Tracks in the earth lead from one staircase to the other, and other trails go from both staircases to the center of the bare west wall. Four neatly made cots are set in a row against the south wall.</blockquote>\n\n<br>Buried under the earthen floor are eight human <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OGFjZjBlMWM5YWU0 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>skeletons</a></strong>—the animated remains of dead Vallakians that were stolen from the church cemetery (area N1, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YWIzMjIyNzE0OGFk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Areas of Vallaki</a>) and animated by Lady Wachter. They rise up and attack intruders who cross the floor. The skeletons don’t attack anyone who utters the phrase “Let the dead remain at rest” before setting foot on the floor. Only Lady Wachter, her sons, her servants, and her loyal cult fanatics know the pass phrase.<br><br>The cots are here for cultists to spend the night.<br><br>The footprints in the dirt give away the location of a secret door in the center of the western wall. Consequently, no ability check is required to locate it. The door is soundproof and pivots open on a central axis.<br><br><hr><br><h3>N4t. Cult Headquarters</h3><blockquote>Flickering candles in iron holders fill this room with light and shadows. This room has a ten-foot-high ceiling and a large black pentagram inscribed on the stone floor. At each point of the pentagram rests a wooden chair. Seated in four of the five chairs are men and women in black robes with hoods: a young man who has the face of an angel; a balding hulk of a man; a squat, middle-aged woman; and a taller, younger woman with an unsettling glare.

Road Junction</h3><blockquote>The road branches north and climbs a rocky escarpment, ending at a gatehouse built into a twenty-foot-high wall of stone reinforced with buttresses every fifty feet or so. The wall encloses a settlement on the side of a snow-dusted mountain spur. Beyond the wall you see the tops of snow-covered pines and thin, white wisps of smoke. The somber toll of a bell comes from a stone abbey that clings to the mountainside high above the settlement. The steady chime is inviting—a welcome change from the deathly silence and oppressive fog to which you have grown accustomed. It’s hard to tell at this distance, but there seems to be a switchback road clinging to the cliffs that lead up from the walled settlement to the abbey.</blockquote><br>The Old Svalich Road continues west from this location for a little more than a mile before it plunges into the foggy curtain that surrounds Barovia (see \"Mists of Ravenloft\" in the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=M2Y0ZjdlMmFhN2Fj ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Lay of the Land</a> handout). Characters who follow the road north arrive at the gatehouse (area S2).<br><br><hr><br><h3>S2. Gatehouse</h3>The map of Krezk includes a diagram of the gatehouse.<br><br><blockquote>The air grows colder as you approach the walled settlement. Two square towers with peaked roofs flank a stone archway into which is set a pair of twelve-foot-tall, ironbound wooden doors. Carved into the arch above the doors is a name: Krezk.<br><br>The walls that extend from the gatehouse are twenty feet high. Atop the parapet you see four figures wearing fur hats and clutching spears. They watch you nervously.</blockquote><br>Cut into the upper floor of each tower is an arrow slit 6 inches wide, 4 feet tall, and 1 foot deep. An open doorway leads from the archer’s post in each tower to the adjacent parapet. Behind the walls, wooden ladders lead from the parapets to the ground 20 feet below.<br><br>Two archers (LG male and female human <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ODRmZmMyMmU1YWRk ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>scouts</a></strong>) are stationed inside the gatehouse, one in each tower. Four <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NGVjOTU0NmM3ODMy ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>guards</a></strong> (LG male and female humans) man the adjacent walls. If the characters are seen flying or climbing over the walls, the guards assume that the village is under attack and cry out in alarm. Five rounds after the alarm sounds, every able-bodied adult in the village arrives at the gatehouse, ready for battle. Krezk’s militia consists of four more guards plus forty <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OWYxMjNkNjFkMTdj ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>commoners</a></strong> (LG male and female humans) armed with handaxes.<br><br>The double doors are made of thick wood planks bound with iron bands and sealed shut with a heavy wooden bar held in iron brackets. The bar can be lifted with a successful DC 15 Strength check. The doors require a siege engine to break them open.<br><br>There aren’t enough people in Krezk to adequately defend its outer wall. Every 300-foot stretch of wall is watched over by a lone <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NGVjOTU0NmM3ODMy ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>guard</a></strong> (LG male or female human). The guards are trained to crouch behind the wall and sound the alarm at any sign of danger.<br><br><h4>Burgomaster Dmitri Krezkov</h4>Picture: <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NmE2YzU5ZjE1OWJm ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Handout: Baron Krezkov</a><br><br>If the characters ask to be let inside or otherwise draw the attention of the guards on the wall, one of the guards fetches the burgomaster, Dmitri Krezkov (LG male human <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NTQ0NTQyYjBjN2Vl ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>noble</a></strong>). His ancestors built Krezk at the foot of the abbey after Strahd’s armies conquered the valley.<br><br>Dmitri is a lord and expects to be treated like one. He places the safety of his village above the welfare of strangers. He has seen adventurers before and assumes that the characters are Strahd’s allies or enemies; either way, their presence spells trouble for Krezk. Dmitri isn’t prepared to shelter Strahd’s enemies any more than he is willing to humor Strahd’s allies. The only way the characters can earn his favor is to help Krezk in some way, whereupon Dmitri is required by his oath of office and his honor as a Barovian noble to show them hospitality. If the characters ask what they can do, Dmitri asks them to secure a wagonload of wine from the Wizard of Wines winery to the south. His people have been without wine for days, and the next delivery is long overdue.<br><br>If the characters force their way into town using magic or strength of arms, Dmitri tells his guards to stand down, hoping to avoid bloodshed, and does everything he can to expedite the characters’ departure.<br><br>A character who succeeds on a DC 12 Wisdom (Insight) check can discern that Dmitri is trying to hide the fact that he is distraught. He is grieving over the natural death of his youngest son, Ilya—the last of his children (see area S3).<br><br><hr><br><h3>S3. Village of Krezk</h3>When the characters get past the outer wall, read:<br><br><blockquote>The mist-shrouded village beyond the wall is nothing more than a scattering of humble wooden cottages along dirt roads that stretch between stands of snow-dusted pine trees—so many trees, in fact, as to constitute a forest. To the northeast, gray cliffs rise sharply, and the road winding up to the abbey is easy to see from this vantage.</blockquote><br>The village operates as a commune, with no exports or moneymaking businesses. Villagers grow trees and vegetables, cut wood to heat their homes, raise chickens and pigs, and share their food. A few villagers have cows and mules, but there are no horses in Krezk. The village has no inns or taverns. Characters who are willing to chop wood, milk cows, or perform other chores can spend the night in the burgomaster’s cottage or some other residence.<br><br><h4>Cottages</h4>Krezk’s residences are single-story pine cottages with stone chimneys and thatch roofs. Pigs and chickens are kept in indoor pens and coops so that they don’t freeze.<br><br><strong><em>Burgomaster’s Cottage.</em> </strong>The building closest to the outer gate is the burgomaster’s cottage—the largest building in town but still a modest dwelling. Dmitri Krezkov and his fearless wife Anna (LG female human <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NTQ0NTQyYjBjN2Vl ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>noble</a></strong>) have no living children. The last of their four children, Ilya, died of an illness seven days ago at the age of fourteen. Given their age, the Krezkovs are unlikely to have more children—a source of great consternation to everyone in the village, since that means the end of the Krezkov bloodline.<br><br>The burgomaster’s cottage has a wine cellar (currently empty) and lots of space for pigpens and chicken coops. Behind the cottage is a graveyard where deceased members of the Krezkov family are interred. Dmitri and Anna’s four children, all of whom died of illness, are buried here. Several of the family caskets are empty, their contents stolen in the night by the Abbot’s mongrelfolk gravediggers (see area S6). Ilya’s plot is fresh and undisturbed, since he was interred only four days ago.<br><br><strong><em>Commoner Cottages.</em> </strong>A typical cottage is only 200 square feet yet contains 1d4 adults (LG male and female human <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OWYxMjNkNjFkMTdj ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>commoners</a></strong>), 1d4 − 1 children (LG male and female human noncombatants), plus the family’s pigs, hares, and chickens.<br><br>Every cottage has its own graveyard where family members are interred. All the caskets planted in the past decade are now empty, thanks to the Abbot’s sneaky mongrelfolk gravediggers (see area S6).<br><br><h4>Krezk Lore</h4>In addition to the information known to all Barovians (see “Barovian Lore” in the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NDM2ZTc2NDNmODQw ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Barovians</a> handout), the villagers of Krezk (called Krezkites) know the following bits of local lore:<br><br><ul><li>Residents never leave the village for fear of being attacked by wolves, dire wolves, and werewolves.</li><li>About once a month, a wagonload of wine arrives from the Wizard of Wines (chapter 12), the winery and vineyard to the south. The business is owned and operated by the Martikov family.</li><li>Burgomaster Krezkov recently lost his fourteen-year-old son, Ilya, to illness. Ilya was the last of the four Krezkov children.</li><li>A pool at the north end of the village provides fresh water throughout the year. Next to the pool, the village’s ancestors built a shrine to the Morninglord in a gazebo. It’s known as the Shrine of the White Sun.</li><li>The Abbey of Saint Markovia is named after a priest of the Morninglord who took a stand against the devil Strahd. After a fierce uprising, Markovia and her most loyal followers stormed Castle Ravenloft, only to be destroyed.</li><li>The abbey was once a hospital and a convent, but it fell on hard times after the land was swallowed up by the mists. Some of the clergy fell prey to Strahd, while others went mad and either starved themselves to death or turned to cannibalism.</li><li>The head of the abbey, called simply the Abbot, arrived over a century ago and hasn’t aged a day since. He occasionally visits the Shrine of the White Sun but doesn’t talk much, and he demands tribute in the form of wine. No one knows his true name or where he came from, and many believe he’s Strahd’s servant or the vampire himself in disguise.</li><li>No one from the village visits the abbey anymore. The abbey’s bell rings at odd times, day and night, and the place is filled with baleful screams and horrible, inhuman laughter that can be heard throughout the village.</li></ul><br><hr><br><h3>S4. Pool and Shrine</h3><blockquote>Even under gray skies, this pool at the north end of the village shimmers and sparkles. Near its shore sits an old gazebo on the verge of collapse. A wooden statue of a mournful, bare-chested man, its paint chipped and faded, stands in the gazebo with arms outstretched, as though waiting to be embraced.</blockquote><br>The pool is fed by an underground spring and was blessed long ago by Saint Markovia. Its waters defy corruption, and anyone who drinks from it for the first time gains the benefit of a<em> <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=ODg0ZThmMmJhMmIw ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>lesser restoration</a></em> spell. (The water once had even greater magic but has weakened over the years.) The water otherwise tastes sweet and fresh.<br><br>The gazebo is so frail that it wouldn’t take more than a strong wind to knock it over. It remains standing because it’s protected from the elements by the surrounding trees, walls, and cliffs. The statue is a depiction of the Morninglord, positioned so that he is reaching toward the east (the dawn). Locals refer to the statue and gazebo as the Shrine of the White Sun, though they have no idea why their ancestors named it so.<br><br><h4><span style=\"color: rgb( 99 , 36 , 35 )\">Fortunes of Ravenloft</span></h4>If your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, the item is hidden under the gazebo. The gazebo must be torn down to reach it, and doing that doesn’t sit well with the locals. If the characters damage the gazebo and don’t repair it, any Charisma checks they make to shift the attitudes of the villagers have disadvantage.<br><br><hr><br><h3>S5. Winding Road</h3><blockquote>The switchback road that hugs the cliff is ten feet wide and covered with loose gravel and chunks of broken rock. The ascent is slow and somewhat treacherous, and the air grows colder as one nears the top.</blockquote><br>The road climbs 400 feet, doubling back on itself twice before reaching <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MmIyZjFmYmJlZDZj ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area S6</a>.</section>","img":"modules/cor-cos/journal/008_-_Chapter_8_3A_The_Village_of_Krezk/001_-_Areas_of_Krezk/avatar.webp"}

Players creating 1st-level characters can use the haunted one character background in appendix A, or they can pick backgrounds from the <em>Player’s Handbook</em> as normal.<br><br>Before the characters can explore the haunted townhouse known as <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MGFjNmUzYzExN2M0 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Death House</a>, you need to guide them to the village of Barovia. The “<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MDg4MGRkMjVjMjhk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Creeping Fog</a>” adventure hook in chapter 1 works best, as it introduces few distractions. Once the characters arrive in Strahd’s domain, steer them to the village. For the duration of this introductory adventure, any attempt by the characters to explore other locations in Strahd’s domain causes the mists of Ravenloft to block their path.<br><br><h3>Level Advancement</h3>In this mini-adventure, the characters gain levels by accomplishing specific goals, rather than by slaying monsters. These milestones are as follows:<br><br><ul><li>Characters who gain access to the secret stairs in the attic (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MGFjNmUzYzExN2M0 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area 21</a>) advance to 2nd level. The stairs appear only under certain circumstances.</li><li>Characters advance to 3rd level once they escape from the house (see the “<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ODIzOGYxMTkyMDNi ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Endings: Death House</a>” handout).</li></ul><br><h3>History</h3><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MGFjNmUzYzExN2M0 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Death House</a> is the name given to an old row house in the village of Barovia (area E7 on the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YWZmNWU5OGQ4ZmJl ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Village of Barovia</a> map). The house has been burned to the ground many times, only to rise from the ashes time and again—by its own will or that of Strahd. Locals give the building a wide berth for fear of antagonizing the evil spirits believed to haunt it.<br><br>The wealthy family that built the house practiced the dark arts. Through seduction and indoctrination, they expanded their cult to include a small yet nefarious circle of friends. When word got out, the rest of the village turned a blind eye to the house and the nightly debaucheries happening within it.<br><br>The cult tried to summon malevolent extraplanar entities with no success. The cultists also preyed on visitors, sacrificed them in bizarre rituals, and hosted morbid banquets to feast on their corpses. When nothing came of these ritualized murders, the cultists’ activities became thinly disguised excuses to indulge their lurid fantasies. The ranks of the cult thinned as members began to lose interest in the debacle.<br><br>Then Strahd von Zarovich arrived.<br><br>The cultists regarded Strahd as a messiah sent to them by the Dark Powers. Drawn to Strahd like moths to a flame, they pledged their devotion for a promise of immortality, but Strahd turned them away, deeming the cult and its leaders unworthy of his attention. The cultists withdrew to Death House in despair.<br><br>The cult’s habit of trapping and devouring wayward visitors proved to be its downfall. On one occasion, the cult snared a band of adventurers whom Strahd had lured to his domain to be his playthings. A black carriage arrived at Death House soon thereafter, and from out of its black heart stepped the vampire himself. The cultists tried to impress Strahd. In response, he slaughtered them for slaying his playthings. Centuries later, the cultists’ spirits haunt the dungeons under the house. The building itself, it seems, is unwilling to let the cult be forgotten.<br><br><h3>Rose and Thorn</h3>Picture: <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=Y2YzOGFlOTg2MmE0 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Handout: Rose and Thorn</a><br><br>The characters are pulled into Strahd’s domain by the mists of Ravenloft. Forced to follow a lonely road (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NDFhNjJjZDAyMGU3 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Areas of Barovia</a>, area A), they eventually arrive at the village of Barovia (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NDFhNjJjZDAyMGU3 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Areas of Barovia</a>, area E). Once they reach the village, read:<br><br><blockquote>The gravel road leads to a village, its tall houses dark as tombstones. Nestled among these solemn dwellings are a handful of closed-up shops. Even the tavern is shut tight.<br><br>A soft whimpering draws your eye toward a pair of children standing in the middle of an otherwise lifeless street.</blockquote><br>The children are ten-year-old Rosavalda (“Rose”) and her seven-year-old brother, Thornboldt (“Thorn”). Thorn is weeping and clutching a stuffed doll. Rose is trying to hush the boy.<br><br>If the characters approach the children or call out to them, add the following:<br><br><blockquote>After shushing the boy, the girl turns to you and says, “There’s a monster in our house!” She then points to a tall brick row house that has seen better days. Its windows are dark. It has a gated portico on the ground floor, and the rusty gate is slightly ajar. The houses on either side are abandoned, their windows and doors boarded up.</blockquote><br>Characters who question the children learn the following information:<br><br><ul><li>The children don’t know what the “monster” looks like, but they’ve heard its terrible howls.</li><li>Their parents (Gustav and Elisabeth Durst) keep the monster trapped in the basement.</li><li>There’s a baby (Walter) in the third-floor nursery. (Untrue, but the children believe it.)</li></ul>Rose and Thorn say that they won’t go back in the house until they know the monster is gone. They can be convinced to wait in the portico (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MGFjNmUzYzExN2M0 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area 1A</a>) while the characters search the house. Although they appear to be flesh-and-blood children, Rose and Thorn are actually illusions created by the house to lure the characters inside. The children don’t know that they’re illusions but vanish if attacked or forced into the house.<br><br>The children died of starvation centuries ago after their insane parents locked them in the attic and forgot about them. They were too young and innocent to understand that their parents were guilty of heinous crimes. Their parents told them stories about a monster in the basement to keep the children from going down to the dungeon level. The “terrible howls” they heard were actually the screams of the cult’s victims.<br><br><h3>The Mists</h3>Characters who remain outside the house can see the mists close in around them, swallowing up the rest of the village. As more buildings disappear into the mists, the characters are left with little choice but to seek refuge in the house. The mists stop short of entering the house but engulf anyone outside (see chapter 2, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=M2Y0ZjdlMmFhN2Fj ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Lay of the Land</a> handout for information on the mists’ effect).<br></section>","img":"modules/cor-cos/journal/018_-_Appendix_B_3A_Death_House/000_-_Intro_to_Appendix_B/avatar.webp"}

Hundreds more soldiers collide in a storm of screams and clashing metal.</blockquote><br>Characters can move through this ghostly battlefield unscathed, and they can’t harm the foggy forms around them. The soldiers aren’t solid enough for the characters to discern emblems or insignia, but it’s clear that both armies are human.<br><br>If the characters have not yet explored Argynvostholt (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MWFkNWYyMTE0NWNj ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>chapter 7</a>), add:<br><br><blockquote>You hear a thunderous roar, and seconds later a huge dragon made of silver mist glides overhead, dispersing enemy soldiers with each flap of its mighty wings.

He claims that the “gods of light” want the Krezkov bloodline restored.<br><br>The characters can try to interfere in the raising of Ilya Krezkov. Otherwise, the burgomaster digs up his son’s corpse. Without needing the requisite material components, the Abbot casts a <em>raise dead</em>, returning Ilya to life with 1 hit point. Anna Krezkova praises the Abbot and Saint Markovia for this generous act before tending to her son. The burgomaster, his grief dispelled, fears that he has misjudged the Abbot and has no way to repay him for this supreme act of kindness.<br><br><h4>Development</h4>Ilya Krezkov returns to life with a random form of indefinite madness (see <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZDY1OWMzM2NkMDU2 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Madness</a>). <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YzY2YTNiNmZjYmZj ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>The Abbot</a> uses the raising of Ilya as leverage to get the burgomaster to undertake an unusual quest (see “Something Borrowed” below).<br><hr><br><h3>Something New</h3>The characters learn that a Krezkite woman named Dimira Yolensky (LG female human noncombatant) is about to give birth.

In the absence of a priest, the burgomaster’s wife, Anna Krezkova, is called upon to supervise the blessed event and offer prayers for the health of the mother and the child.<br><br>Dimira gives birth to a healthy baby boy, but the baby doesn’t cry. While the mother coddles the infant, characters who succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom (Insight) check can see that Kretyana is deeply troubled. If the characters question the midwife, she tells them in confidence, “That child has no soul. Very sad.”<br><br>Kretyana was raised to believe that newborns are soulless if they don’t cry, and she has come to believe, rightly, that most <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NDM2ZTc2NDNmODQw ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Barovians</a> lack souls.<br><hr><br><h3>Something Borrowed</h3><br><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YzY2YTNiNmZjYmZj ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>The Abbot</a> needs a bridal gown. He doesn’t trust the mongrelfolk to find one, so he pays a visit to Burgomaster Krezkov and instructs him to obtain a gown within a month, either as compensation for raising his dead son (see “Something Old” above) or on pain of death.<br><br>No one in <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=OWRkMTE5ZDk1Mjg2 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Krezk</a> can fashion such a gown, leaving the burgomaster with no choice but to look elsewhere. His wife, Anna, says she should personally lead a well-armed group of Krezkites to the east to Vallaki.<br><br>Anna Krezkova (LG female human <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NTQ0NTQyYjBjN2Vl ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>noble</a></strong>) bids her husband farewell and leaves with two <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NGVjOTU0NmM3ODMy ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>guards</a></strong>, four <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OWYxMjNkNjFkMTdj ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>commoners</a></strong>, and a <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZWM2MzM2NDNiYzhl ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>mule</a></strong> laden with provisions. If the characters are present, the burgomaster urges them to provide escort. If they agree, check for random encounters as they make their way along the Old Svalich Road, as normal. If the guards at Vallaki’s gates can be convinced to let them in, Anna and the characters can begin searching for a bridal gown or a dressmaker. Local dressmakers are willing to fashion a gown for 50 gp, but Anna can’t afford it, and the dress won’t be finished in time. The dressmakers are quick to point out that <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=Y2IxMjA3MWU3MGQy ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Baroness Lydia Petrovna</a>, the wife of Vallaki's burgomaster, owns a beautiful white bridal gown (see the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MmIxNGM4MWU0NTk0 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Burgomaster's Mansion</a>, area N3p). The baroness, eager to please, is willing to give up her dress for a good cause, although her husband won’t allow it and could care less about Krezk’s problems.<br><br>If the characters don’t accompany Anna on her quest, her expedition falls prey to the perils of the wilderness and never returns. Krezkov sends more villagers to find them, and these villagers are also lost. Unwilling to risk any more lives, Krezkov visits the abbey for the first time in his life and makes a desperate plea to the Abbot, who ignores the plea. Characters can escort the burgomaster to the abbey or eavesdrop on the burgomaster’s conversation with the Abbot. If they do, they hear the Abbot promise “divine retribution” as punishment.<br><br>The evening after the burgomaster’s visit, the Abbot releases all the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTgwYWMxZDZhZTMx ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>mongrelfolk</a> in the abbey’s madhouse (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MmIyZjFmYmJlZDZj ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area S15</a>) and sets them on the village. They steal pigs, chickens, and anything else that’s edible. None of the villagers are harmed, but their food supplies are depleted, and 2d6 mongrelfolk are killed. The surviving mongrelfolk return to the abbey with their plunder. The burgomaster is so distraught that he hangs himself from the rafters of his cottage a few days later.<br><br>The characters can stop all this from happening by delivering the dress to the Abbot. They can also stop the mayhem by halting the mongrelfolk as they descend from the abbey or by killing the Abbot beforehand.<br><br><h4>Development</h4>If Lydia Petrovna’s bridal gown is delivered to the Abbot, he honors whatever deal he made with the characters. If the characters resort to magical trickery (for example, creating an illusory dress), the Abbot becomes hostile toward them once the deception is revealed.<br><hr><br><h3>Something Blue</h3>This encounter occurs if the characters bring <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YjY2YzRmODJjYmNl ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Ireena Kolyana</a> to <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=OWRkMTE5ZDk1Mjg2 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Krezk</a>, as the priest <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZjIxMDYwN2RhZjcx ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Donavich</a> suggested (see the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NDJiYjA5YTE0MjJl ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Church</a> in the village of Barovia).<br><br>Ireena hears a gentle voice calling to her. It leads her to the edge of the blessed pool (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=OWRkMTE5ZDk1Mjg2 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area S4</a>). If the characters follow her, read:<br><br><blockquote>As Ireena reaches the pool’s edge, an image appears in its sparkling blue waters: a handsome youth of kind and noble visage. The sadness in his eyes turns to sudden joy.<br><br>“Tatyana!” he says. “It has been so long! Come, my love. Let us be together at last.”<br><br>Ireena gasps and puts a hand on her heart. “My beloved Sergei! In life, you were a prince and a man of faith. We were to be married long ago. Has this blessed pool called your spirit to me?” She reaches toward the water’s surface as a hand of water rises up to take hers.</blockquote><br>If the characters intervene, pulling Ireena away from the water’s grasp, the hand sinks back into the pool, Sergei’s image fades, and she cries as she screams his name.<br><br>If the characters allow her to take the hand, read:<br><br><blockquote>Ireena is pulled into the pool and embraces Sergei beneath the rippling water. You have never seen a happier couple as they both begin to fade from view.<br></blockquote><br>The spirit of Sergei takes Ireena to a place where Strahd can’t harm her. She is safe with him.<br><br>Whether or not Sergei takes Ireena, Strahd senses that the two have found each other. He reacts as follows:<br><br><blockquote>A peal of thunder shakes the land, and the dark clouds coalesce into a terrible visage. A deep, dark voice from beyond the mountains cries out, “She is mine!” A terrible crack resounds as blue lightning splits the sky and strikes the pool.</blockquote><br>Each creature within 15 feet of the pool must make a successful DC 17 Dexterity check or be knocked prone. The blast knocks down the old gazebo as well. A creature in the water when the lightning strikes must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 44 (8d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.<br><br>Strahd’s wrath destroys the blessing on the pool, rendering its waters nonmagical and preventing the spirit of Sergei from manifesting in them again.<br><br><h4>Development</h4>If Sergei and Ireena are brought together, Ireena is no longer within Strahd’s grasp. Strahd blames the characters for his loss and seeks to destroy them from this moment on. Not long afterward, he has one of his servants deliver a letter to the characters, inviting them to Castle Ravenloft.

The vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich stares down a sheer cliff at the village below. A cold, bitter wind spins dead leaves about him, billowing his cape in the darkness.<br /><br />Lightning splits the clouds overhead, casting stark white light across him. Strahd turns to the sky, revealing the angular muscles of his face and hands. He has a look of power&mdash;and of madness. His once handsome face is contorted by a tragedy darker than the night itself.<br /><br />Rumbling thunder pounds the castle spires. The wind&rsquo;s howling increases as Strahd turns his gaze back to the village. Far below, yet not beyond his ken, a party of adventurers has just entered his domain. Strahd&rsquo;s face forms a twisted smile as his dark plan unfolds. He knew they were coming, and he knows why they have come&mdash;all according to his plan. He, the master of Ravenloft, will attend to them.<br /><br />Another lightning flash rips through the darkness, its thunder echoing through the castle&rsquo;s towers. But Strahd is gone. Only the howling of the wind&mdash;or perhaps a lone wolf&mdash;fills the midnight air. The master of Ravenloft is having guests for dinner. And you are invited.<br /><br />\n<h3>Running the Adventure</h3>\n<em>Curse of Strahd </em>is a story of gothic horror, presented here as a Dungeons &amp; Dragons roleplaying game adventure for a party of four to six adventurers of levels 1&ndash;10. A balance of character classes is helpful, since the adventurers will face a variety of challenges. Each character class will certainly have its moment to shine.<br /><br />Most of the handouts are meant for you, the Dungeon Master, alone. We recommend you read the entire adventure before attempting to run it. It assumes that you have the fifth edition <em>Player&rsquo;s Handbook</em>, <em>Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide</em>, and <em>Monster Manual</em>.<br /><br />When a creature&rsquo;s name appears in <strong>bold</strong> type, that&rsquo;s a visual cue pointing you to the creature&rsquo;s stat block.<br /><br />Spells and nonmagical equipment mentioned in the adventure are described in the <em>Player&rsquo;s Handbook</em>.<br /><br />\n<blockquote>Text that appears in this format is meant to be read aloud or paraphrased for players when their characters first arrive at a location or under a specific circumstance, as described in the text. Indoor and nighttime descriptions are written with the assumption that the adventurers are using a torch or other light source to see by.</blockquote>\n<br />\n<h4>Story Overview</h4>\nAdventurers from a foreign land find themselves in Barovia, a mysterious realm surrounded by deadly fog and ruled by Strahd von Zarovich, a vampire and wizard. Using a deck of tarokka cards to predict their future, a fortune-teller named Madam Eva sets them on a dark course that takes them to many corners of Barovia, culminating with a vampire hunt in Castle Ravenloft.<br /><br />Madam Eva&rsquo;s people are called the Vistani. They travel in covered wagons from world to world, luring strangers into Strahd&rsquo;s domain.<br /><br />Barovia is a land of ghosts, werewolves, and other fell creatures. The wilderness hides many secrets, including forgotten ruins and battlefields that tell the story of Strahd&rsquo;s life as a conqueror. Adventurers who explore the wilderness find the remnants of Strahd&rsquo;s ancient enemies, not all of them as dead as one might expect.<br /><br />For the people of Barovia, there is no escape from this harsh land. The town of Vallaki stands ready to defend itself against the servants of Strahd, but it&rsquo;s far from the sanctuary it purports to be. The village of Krezk lies near the edge of Strahd&rsquo;s domain, its abbey now in the clutches of evil, misguided creatures.<br /><br />Of all the settlements in Strahd&rsquo;s domain, the village of Barovia is by far the most oppressed. Many of its shops are closed, and the locals have succumbed to despair. It is well known that Strahd desires the burgomaster&rsquo;s adopted daughter, Ireena Kolyana. The villagers neither protect nor harm her, lest they incur the vampire&rsquo;s wrath. Few know that Ireena bears an uncanny resemblance to Tatyana, Strahd&rsquo;s dead beloved.<br /><br />The village of Barovia cowers in the shadow of Castle Ravenloft, Strahd&rsquo;s home and fortress. The castle stands atop a great spire of rock, invincible and ever watchful. Every night, thousands of bats fly out of the castle to feed. It is said that Strahd sometimes flies with them. Barovia will never be safe until the evil in his castle is destroyed.<br /><br />Once Strahd becomes aware of the adventurers, he and his spies watch them closely. When the time is right, Strahd invites his &ldquo;guests&rdquo; to Castle Ravenloft (see <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"Zjg4NWJkMTlhNDA1\">Handout: Strahd's Invitation</a>). He aims to turn them against one another, torment them, and kill them, as he has done with so many other visitors. Some will become undead thralls. Others will never rise again.<br /><br />The adventurers&rsquo; best hope of defeating Strahd is to learn his secrets, for he is no ordinary vampire. Guided by Madam Eva&rsquo;s card reading, they must scour his domain and his castle for magic items that might weaken or slay him, all the while trying to stay alive.<br /><br />Although the adventurers can escape by slaying Strahd, he can&rsquo;t be truly destroyed. Barovia is his prison, and not even death can free him from his curse.<br />The adventure ends when either Strahd von Zarovich or the characters are defeated. Your goal is to keep Strahd in play for as long as possible, using all the abilities and resources at his disposal.<br /><br />\n<h4>Adventure Structure</h4>\nMuch of the adventure&rsquo;s action is driven by the clash between the adventurers&rsquo; decisions and Strahd&rsquo;s goals, and the adventurers and the vampire are all caught in strands of fate that are represented by a special card reading detailed in chapter 1, &ldquo;Into the Mists.&rdquo; Before you run the adventure, you need to conduct that reading to determine the location of several items that are key to the story, as well as one of the locations where Strahd can be found.<br /><br /><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"YWI3NzNiZWE4OGE2\">Chapter 1</a> also outlines Strahd&rsquo;s goals, and it suggests <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"MjViMWI0Mzk0NjU2\">adventure hooks</a> to draw the player characters into the cursed realm of Barovia. If the characters are 1st level, the character background in appendix A is available to them, and consider starting their time in Barovia with the mini-adventure <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"MGFjNmUzYzExN2M0\">Death House</a> in appendix B.<br /><br /><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"ZThhZTJiNDViZGY2\">Chapter 2</a>, &ldquo;The Lands of Barovia,&rdquo; provides an overview of the realm and includes special rules for it and its people, including the mysterious <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"NzAzZjc4MGFjNWZk\">Vistani</a>. <br /><br />Chapters 3&ndash;15 detail areas that correspond to places on the map of Barovia in chapter 2.<br /><br />The epilogue offers ways for you to end the adventure. Various handouts in the Magic Items folder detail the special items&mdash;magical or otherwise&mdash;introduced in the adventure, and the Monsters &amp; NPCs provides character sheets with stat blocks for <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"ZTZiYzA5N2ViNTZi\">Strahd</a> and various NPCs and monsters that can be met in Barovia. Appendix E shows the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"M2M5MzJhYjk3OGEw\">tarokka</a> cards that the Vistani use for their fortune telling.<br /><br />\n<h4>Character Levels</h4>\nThe adventure is meant for characters of levels 1&ndash;10 and includes threats for those levels and beyond. Strahd can be an especially deadly challenge at these levels. It is assumed that the characters will gain levels over the course of the adventure, as well as acquire allies and powerful magic items that can tip the scales in their favor. Characters who head directly to Castle Ravenloft without first increasing their power will likely die.<br /><br />You can award experience points for the defeat of foes, use milestone awards, or a mixture of both. Given the fact that much of the adventure involves social interaction and exploration, rather than combat, your work will probably be easier if you use milestone awards. Appropriate milestone awards include the following:<br /><br /><strong><em>Finding Artifacts.</em></strong> The characters gain a level when they obtain the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"OGIyOGYxMWU1ODgw\"><em>Tome of Strahd</em></a>, the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"MGZkYThiODViN2Yw\"><em>Sunsword</em></a>, or the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"YmY5ZjM2YTY3ZDgz\"><em>Holy Symbol of Ravenkind</em></a>.<br /><br /><strong><em>Defeating Villains.</em></strong> The characters gain a level when they defeat the featured antagonist(s) in a location, such as the hags in <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"MDYyMDU5ZmM4Y2I1\">Old Bonegrinder</a> (chapter 6).<br /><br /><strong><em>Accomplishing Story Goals.</em></strong> The characters gain a level when they accomplish something significant, such lighting the beacon of <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"OGZkMWVkZjExOTc5\">Argynvostholt Ground Floor</a> (chapter 7), thwarting the druids&rsquo; ritual atop <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"ZWI2YTFiNTM4ZWFk\">Yester Hill</a> (chapter 14), or forging an alliance with <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"ZTFlNDZhMzkxNDAy\">Ezmerelda d&rsquo;Avenir</a>.<br /><br />Appendix B, &ldquo;<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"MGFjNmUzYzExN2M0\">Death House</a>,&rdquo; uses milestone awards by way of example.<br /><br />Be prepared for the fact that the adventure is exceedingly open-ended&mdash;one of the hallmarks of the original <em>Ravenloft</em>. The card reading <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"ZGJlZmE4NDdhOGRj\">Fortunes of Ravenloft</a> in chapter 1 and the adventurers&rsquo; choices can lead them all over the map, and a party can easily wander into an area well beyond their power. If you&rsquo;d like to steer them toward places that correspond to their level, consult the Areas by Level table below, but beware of undermining the sense that the characters&rsquo; choices matter. Sometimes the adventurers will simply need to flee or hide when they are out of their depth.<br /><br />If an area of the adventure ends up feeling free of mystery or danger, consider using tips from the &ldquo;Marks of Horror&rdquo; section below to increase the ominousness. If a combat encounter feels too easy, either (a) guide it to its end as quickly as possible or (b) increase the threat by raising a foe&rsquo;s hit point maximum to the upper end of its hit point range, by adding monsters/traps, or both.<br /><br />\n<h5>Areas by Level</h5>\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">Avg.

Nearing the top, they begin to hear the beating of a heart in the darkness above. Not a human heart, but the heart of something monstrous and horrible. Such is the nature of gothic horror: fear bred by anticipation and the dark realization that all will be truly and horribly revealed in time.<br /><br />The following tips can help you make this adventure a chilling experience for you and your players.<br /><br />\n<h4>The Unknown</h4>\nHorror is born out of fear of the unknown. Our fear is heightened when the darkness engulfs us and we can&rsquo;t see, or when the truth is behind a locked door, covered by a sheet, or buried in the soft earth. It&rsquo;s not the monster, but its shadow, that breeds horror. The more we know about a monster, the less we fear it, so the trick is to keep it out of the light for as long as possible. Here are two tricks to heighten fear of the unknown:<br /><br />\n<ul>\n<li>When it seems as though the characters have everything under control, you can have a gust of wind suddenly blow out their torches, plunging them into darkness.</li>\n<li>Before a monster appears, take a moment to describe the odor that precedes it, the eerie sound it makes, or the weird shadow it casts.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Foreshadowing</h4>\nForeshadowing is about finding clues to a horrible truth yet to be revealed. Consider the following examples:<br /><br />\n<ul>\n<li>Before characters encounter a monster, hint at the monster&rsquo;s presence with clues such as claw marks, gnawed bones, and bloodstains.</li>\n<li>Whenever characters take a long rest, give one character a prophetic dream in which he or she glimpses something yet to be found or encountered.</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<h4>Age</h4>\nBarovia is the grim reflection of its undead master. Almost everything here is old and timeworn. Everywhere the adventurers go, they should be reminded of death, decay, and their own mortality. Here are a couple of ways to reinforce these pervasive themes:<br /><br />\n<ul>\n<li>Take time to describe the rotting timbers of buildings, the faded and moth-eaten clothing of the Barovian peasantry, the worm-ridden pages of old books, and the rust on iron fences and gates.</li>\n<li>A character gazing into a mirror, a pool, or other reflective surface might glimpse an older, more decrepit version of himself or herself.</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<h4>Light</h4>\nA tale that is perpetually dark in tone becomes tiresome very quickly. It needs to feature the occasional ray of light for contrast and to create a sense of hope. Monsters and other terrors must be offset with creatures that are kind and lovable, giving the characters even more reasons to stand against the darkness. Here are a couple of ways to add glimmers of light to a tragic tale:<br /><br />\n<ul>\n<li>In a land as dreary as Barovia, take the time to describe the occasional scene of beauty, such as a pretty flower growing atop a grave.</li>\n<li>Make sure that the heroes have contact with NPCs who are honest, friendly, and helpful, such as the Martikovs in Vallaki or the Krezkovs in Krezk.</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<h4>Personification</h4>\nAscribing human characteristics to an inanimate thing is one way to turn something ordinary into something malevolent. A groaning house, the wailing wind, grasping mud, and a squatting chest aren&rsquo;t just mundane things&mdash;they&rsquo;re characters in your story, made all the creepier thanks to their humanlike traits. Torches sputter nervously, rusty hinges shatter silence with their sudden cries of anguish, and cobwebs quietly beckon us to our doom. Here are more examples:<br /><br />\n<ul>\n<li>Imagine darkness as a silent crowd that follows the characters everywhere and stares at them while they sleep.</li>\n<li>Imagine trees as towering giants that stand idle yet ever watchful as characters face the perils of the Svalich Woods alone.</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<h4>Details</h4>\nIn a horror story, there&rsquo;s no telling where danger might be lurking. A leering gargoyle might be a monster in disguise, or merely a fiendish sculpture. A mirror hanging on a wall might have the power to transfix all who gaze into it, or it might be nothing out of the ordinary. In a horror story, taking the time to describe an object in detail draws attention to it, makes one suspicious of it, and might distract from the real danger. Here are a couple of tricks you can use:<br /><br />\n<ul>\n<li>In a given encounter area, choose one object or feature to describe in some detail. It need not be important to the story.</li>\n<li>Allow the character who has the highest passive Wisdom (Perception) score to see, hear, or smell something that no one else can perceive.</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<h4>Humor</h4>\nThere are no stranger bedfellows than horror and humor. Tension can&rsquo;t be sustained indefinitely, so a dash of humor provides a respite, giving horror a chance to sneak up on us later and catch us off guard. While humorous situations will occur naturally in the course of running the adventure, here are some tips for creating humor when needed:<br /><br />\n<ul>\n<li>Allow NPCs (even evil ones) to tell jokes, speak in a funny voice, or behave idiotically. Even morbid humor is better than none.</li>\n<li>When a hero, villain, or monster rolls a natural 1 on an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, describe a humorous mishap that occurs as a result of the low roll, such as a character accidentally knocking over a lamp and setting some drapes on fire while trying to hide or move silently.</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","img":""}

All areas are brightly lit, though shadows abound.<br><hr><br><h3>Z1. Cave Mouth</h3><blockquote>The open jaws of the wolf’s head form a fifteen-foot-high canopy of rock over the cave mouth, held up by natural pillars of rock. The ceiling rises to a height of twenty feet inside the cave. Torches in iron brackets line the walls. From somewhere deep inside, you hear the echoing sounds of a flute. Some of the notes are discordant—painfully so.</blockquote><br>The guards in area Z2 spot characters in the cave mouth who aren’t hidden. Characters can track the sound of the flute to area Z3.<br><br><h4>Development</h4><p>If the characters arrive here with <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZjY1N2ZhZTg1OTUz ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Emil Toranescu</a> (see chapter 4, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YzI0YTFjYTVjY2Jh ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K75a</a>) in their company or their custody, he can command the other werewolves in the den not to attack the characters as they make their way inside.</p><hr><br><h3>Z2. Guard Post</h3><blockquote>Here, the cave splits to the left and right. Standing on a five-foot-high ledge between the divide are two feral-looking women wearing shredded clothing and clutching spears.</blockquote><br>Aziana and Davanka, two <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=N2FhNWZiMTc5Yzdj ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>werewolves</a></strong> in human form, stand guard on the ledge. They sound the alarm when they spot intruders. Any loud noise here can be heard throughout the den, bringing quick reinforcements from areas Z3 and Z5. The werewolves fight to the death.<br><hr><br><h3>Z3. Wolf Den</h3>Nine <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MWM2Nzc5NjRiZTQy ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>wolves</a></strong> and a <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=N2FhNWZiMTc5Yzdj ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>werewolf</a></strong> in human form are here. The werewolf, Skennis, has 36 hit points and is too old to hunt. Left undisturbed, he plays an electrum flute (see “Treasure” below), though not very well. The wolves are huddled behind him and go where he goes. Though well past his prime, he fights to the death to defend the den, and he takes umbrage at anyone who kills any of his wolf allies.<br><br><blockquote>A five-foot-high stone ledge overlooks this large cave, which has a smoldering campfire at the far west end. The floor is covered with gnawed bones.<br></blockquote><br>If Skennis is reduced to 0 hit points, read:<br><br><blockquote>The old man cackles. “When Kiril returns,” he says to you with his last breath, “he’ll skin you alive.”<br></blockquote><br><h4>Treasure</h4>Skennis’s electrum flute is nonmagical and worth 250 gp. Skennis also carries a pouch containing four 50 gp gemstones.<br><hr><br><h3>Z4. Underground Spring</h3><blockquote>A gash in the rocky ceiling allows the gray light and cold drizzle of the outdoors to seep into this dank, torchlit cave, where an underground spring forms a pool of water roughly forty feet across and ten feet deep. A five-foot-high ledge to the north overlooks the pool. A similar ledge spans the eastern wall, with a rough-hewn staircase leading up to it. A few crates sit atop the eastern ledge.</blockquote><br>The water is fresh. The ceiling is roughly 20 feet above the surface of the pool. The fissure in the ceiling is 3 feet wide at its widest point, and 6 inches at its narrowest.<br><br><h4>Z4a. Eastern Ledge</h4>The crates on the eastern ledge contain heaps of adult-sized clothing.<br><hr><br><h3>Z5. Deep Caves</h3><blockquote>A maze of torchlit tunnels and caves expands in front of you. Bones lie strewn upon the floor.</blockquote><br>The ceiling here is 10 feet high. The bones on the floor are a warning system.

South Cave</h4>Bianca, a white-haired <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=N2FhNWZiMTc5Yzdj ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>werewolf</a></strong> in wolf form who is Kiril Stoyanovich’s mate, sleeps here.

North Cave</h4>Wensencia, a <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=N2FhNWZiMTc5Yzdj ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>werewolf</a></strong> in wolf form, sleeps here with Kellen, a ten-year-old werewolf in wolf form. Kellen is a noncombatant with AC 10, 2 hit points, and a werewolf’s damage immunities. He hugs a wooden doll that eerily resembles one of the characters, but is painted and dressed to look like a zombie. A tiny slogan etched into the zombie doll reads, “Is No Fun, Is No Blinsky!”<br><br>When an alarm sounds, Wencensia takes Kellen to area Z7, locks him in one of the empty cages, and tells him to take human form, which he does. She then joins her fellow werewolves in the den’s defense.<br><br>Kellen was kidnapped from his home in Liam’s Hold, a hamlet near the Misty Forest in the Forgotten Realms setting. He was afflicted with werewolf lycanthropy after winning one of Kiril’s despicable contests. Wencensia has been tasked with training this newest member of Kiril’s pack. Casting a <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=NWE2NjRlYWZmMGVm ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>greater restoration</a></em> spell or a <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=Yzg0NGFmODc4NDdl ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>remove curse</a></em> spell on Kellen ends his lycanthropy.<br><hr><br><h3>Z6. Kiril’s Cave</h3><blockquote>At the back of this cave hangs a curtain made of human skin.</blockquote><br>When home, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YTg2NDBjZjMwMzQ1 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Kiril Stoyanovich</a> sleeps here in wolf form.<br><br>Behind the ghastly curtain of stitched flesh is a 10-foot-high, 10-foot-wide tunnel with rough-hewn stairs leading up, interspersed with landings. The tunnel ends at a secret door, beyond which lies area Z8. The secret door is easy to spot from inside the tunnel (no ability check required).<br><hr><br><h3>Z7. Shrine of Mother Night</h3><blockquote>Rough-hewn stairs lead down to a torchlit cave and a bizarre sight: wide-eyed children stand behind wooden bars and stare at you in terrified silence. The cave holds six wooden cages, their lids held shut with heavy rocks. Two of the cages are empty, and each of the others holds a pair of frightened children.<br><br>A crude wooden statue stands between the cages. It bears the rough likeness of a wolf-headed woman draped in garlands of vines and night flowers. Piled around the statue’s base is an incredible amount of treasure. A woman in shredded clothes kneels before the statue. Behind the statue, two maggot-ridden corpses hang from iron shackles bolted to the wall.</blockquote><br>The ceiling here is 20 feet high. The statue is a crude depiction of Mother Night. Kneeling before it is a werewolf in human form named <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NGQ5YzRmZWIxZjhl ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Zuleika Toranescu</a></strong>, who is the wife of Emil (see chapter 4, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YzI0YTFjYTVjY2Jh ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K75a</a>). Believing her mate to be dead by Strahd’s hand, she prays to Mother Night (see also <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NDM2ZTc2NDNmODQw ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Barovians</a>' \"beliefs and superstitions\") for guidance, hoping that the goddess might hold enough sway over Strahd to persuade him to free her beloved.<br><br>Kiril has ordered Zuleika to guard the prisoners. If the characters rescue Emil and return him safely to Zuleika, she gladly releases the children. If the characters confirm that Emil is truly dead, either by their hand or Strahd’s, she still might let the prisoners go if the characters help her deal with <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YTg2NDBjZjMwMzQ1 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Kiril Stoyanovich</a>, whom she blames above all. Zuleika sees the characters as the answer to her prayers and asks them to kill Kiril when he returns from his latest hunt (see “Leader of the Pack” in the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MWM1NGY4ZGIxZjc3 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Special Events: Chapter 15</a> handout). <br><br>Each of the eight children imprisoned here has AC 10, 1 hit point, and no effective attacks. To determine a child’s age in years, roll 1d6 + 6. The rocks piled atop each occupied cage can be knocked or lifted off, allowing the cages to be opened. The children are in shock. Those who are set free don’t wander far from the characters for fear of being eaten by wolves and werewolves.<br><br>The corpses hanging on the wall behind the statue are two Barovian adults, a man and a woman, killed by the pack and presented as offerings to Mother Night. The werewolves consider the feasting maggots to be emblematic of Mother Night’s “feedings.” When the flesh of these corpses has been eaten away, the pack searches for new offerings to take their place.<br><br><h4>Treasure</h4>The treasure piled around the base of Mother Night’s statue includes:<br><br><ul><li>4,500 cp, 900 sp, and 250 gp (all coins of mintages foreign to Barovia)</li><li>Thirty 50 gp gemstones and seven 100 gp gemstones</li><li>Twelve pieces of plain gold jewelry (worth 25 gp each) and a finely wrought gold cloak-pin inlaid with shards of jet (worth 250 gp)</li><li>An ivory drinking horn engraved with dancing dryads and satyr pipe players (worth 250 gp)</li><li>An ornate electrum censer with platinum filigree (worth 750 gp)</li></ul>Anyone who steals from Mother Night is cursed. The werewolves know this, and thus don’t go out of their way to guard the hoard.<br><br>Any creature that takes treasure from this pile is haunted by horrible dreams every night lasting from dusk until dawn. The curse affects only the creature that did the pilfering and isn’t passed on to anyone else who might come into possession of the item. Returning a stolen item to the treasure pile doesn’t end the curse.<br><br>A creature cursed in this way gains no benefit from finishing a short or long rest at night (resting during the day works normally, since the curse is dormant from dawn to dusk). A <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=NWE2NjRlYWZmMGVm ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>greater restoration</a></em> or a<em> <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=Yzg0NGFmODc4NDdl ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>remove curse</a></em> spell cast on the creature ends the curse on it. The curse on the creature also ends if it leaves Barovia.<br><br><h4><span style=\"color: rgb( 99 , 36 , 35 )\">Fortunes of Ravenloft</span></h4>If your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it’s lying amid the other items at the base of the statue. The curse described above applies to this treasure as well.<br><hr><br><h3>Z8. Ring of Stone</h3><blockquote>A twenty-foot-diameter ring of stones dominates a rocky ledge on the mountainside. Within the ring, you see spattered blood and small, gnawed bones. Lying on the ground outside the circle are several spears stained with dry blood.</blockquote><br>The werewolf pack convenes here to watch their young prisoners fight with spears in the stone ring. The last child standing is bitten and turned into a werewolf; then the bodies of the dead are devoured, their bones picked clean.<br><br>Set into the mountainside is a secret door that can be pushed open to reveal a tunnel with rough-hewn stairs leading down to area Z6.<br></section>","img":"modules/cor-cos/journal/015_-_Chapter_15_3A_Werewolf_Den/003_-_Werewolf_Den/avatar.webp"}

Although he can be encountered almost anywhere in his domain, the vampire is always encountered in the place indicated by the card reading later in this chapter, unless he has been forced into his tomb in the catacombs of Castle Ravenloft.<br><br><h3>The Vampire’s History</h3>In life, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTZiYzA5N2ViNTZi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i></a>Strahd von Zarovich was a count, a prince, a soldier, and a conqueror. After the death of his father, King Barov, Strahd waged long, bloody wars against his family’s enemies. He and his army cornered the last of these enemies in a remote mountain valley before slaying them all. Strahd named the valley Barovia, after his deceased father, and was so struck by its scenic beauty that he decided to settle there.<br><br>Queen Ravenovia lamented the death of Barov and was fearful of Strahd. War had made him cold and arrogant. She kept her younger son, Sergei, away from the battlefield. Strahd envied the love and attention his mother visited upon his brother, so in Barovia he remained. Peace made Strahd restless, and he began to feel like his best years were behind him. Unwilling to go the way of his father, Strahd studied magic and forged a pact with the Dark Powers of the Shadowfell in return for the promise of immortality.<br><br>Strahd scoured his conquered lands for wizards and artisans, brought them to the valley of Barovia, and commanded them to raise a castle to rival the magnificent fortresses of his ancestral homeland. Strahd named the castle Ravenloft, after his mother, to demonstrate his love for her. When it was complete, Strahd commanded his mother and brother to come to Barovia and stay with him. Sergei eventually took up residence at Ravenloft, but Ravenovia passed away while traveling to her namesake. In sorrowful disappointment, Strahd sealed his mother’s body in a crypt beneath the castle.<br><br>Strahd’s attention soon turned to Tatyana, a young Barovian woman of fine lineage and remarkable beauty. Strahd believed her to be a worthy bride, and he lavished Tatyana with gifts and attention. Despite Strahd’s efforts, she instead fell in love with the younger, warmer Sergei. Strahd’s pride prevented him from standing in the way of the young couple’s love until the day of Sergei and Tatyana’s wedding, when Strahd gazed into a mirror and realized he had been a fool. Strahd murdered Sergei and drank his blood, sealing the evil pact between Strahd and the Dark Powers. He then chased Sergei’s bride-to-be through the gardens, determined to make her accept and love him. Tatyana hurled herself off a castle balcony to escape Strahd’s pursuit, plunging to her death. Treacherous castle guards, seizing the opportunity to rid the world of Strahd forever, shot their master with arrows.<br><br>But Strahd did not die. The Dark Powers honored the pact they had made. The sky went black as Strahd turned on the guards, his eyes blazing red. He had become a vampire.<br><br>After slaughtering the guards, Strahd saw the faces of his father and mother in the thunderclouds, looking down upon him and judging him. He had destroyed the family bloodline and doomed all of Barovia. The castle and the valley were spirited away, locked in a demiplane surrounded on all sides by deadly fog. For Strahd and his people, there would be no escape.<br><br>Strahd has been the master of Ravenloft for centuries now. Since becoming a vampire, he has taken several consorts—none as beloved as Tatyana, but each a person of beauty. All of them he turned into vampire spawn. Although he feeds on the hapless souls of Barovia, they provide little nourishment and no comfort. From time to time, strangers from faraway lands are brought to his domain, to play the vampire’s game of cat-and-mouse. Strahd savors these moments, for though these strangers offer him no lands to conquer, they aren’t so easily destroyed and therefore provide a welcome diversion.<br><br> Strahd believes that the key to his escaping Barovia lies in finding someone worthy to rule in his stead, but his arrogance are so indomitable that no one is ever good enough in his eyes. He believes in his cold heart that only a von Zarovich as great as he or his father could sway the Dark Powers to release him.<br><br><h3>Strahd’s Goals</h3>Strahd has the following goals in the adventure.<br><br><h4>Turn Ireena Kolyana</h4>Strahd’s unrequited love for Tatyana drove him to slay his brother, Sergei. Some time ago, Strahd glimpsed the young woman <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YjY2YzRmODJjYmNl ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Ireena Kolyana</a> in the village of Barovia and felt extreme déjà vu. Ireena looked exactly like Tatyana! Strahd now believes that Ireena is the latest reincarnation of Tatyana, and thus he seeks to claim her.<br><br>Strahd’s evil courtship has led him to visit Ireena twice. On both occasions, he charmed his way into her home—the house of her adopted father, the burgomaster of the village of Barovia—and drank her blood. He intends to kill Ireena during their next meeting and turn her into his vampire spawn consort.<br><br><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YWZmNWU5OGQ4ZmJl ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Chapter 3</a> gives details about Ireena and where to find her in the village of Barovia.<br><br><h4>Find Rudolph van Richten</h4>Although he is usually focused on making Ireena Kolyana his bride, Strahd has been distracted by reports that a legendary vampire hunter named <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MTY5MmZlODgzNzJi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Rudolph van Richten</a> has come to Barovia. It takes more than one old man with a death wish to frighten Strahd; nevertheless, the vampire has his spies searching Barovia for van Richten. Strahd would like very much to meet the old vampire hunter, lock him in the dungeons of Castle Ravenloft, and slowly break his spirit.<br><br>Chapter 5 describes the town of <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YWIzMjIyNzE0OGFk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Vallaki</a>, where van Richten currently resides incognito.<br><br><h4>Search for a Successor or Consort</h4>Strahd can sense the arrival of new blood in his domain. When newcomers enter Barovia, he shifts his attention from Ireena Kolyana and van Richten to his new guests so that he can determine whether any of them is worthy to be his successor or consort. (Eventually, he decides that none of them can replace him as master of Barovia, but he doesn’t arrive at this conclusion immediately.)<br><br>Strahd pays close attention to adventurers who are charismatic and arrogant, like himself. He focuses his attacks on them, to see how much they can withstand. If they crumble easily, he loses interest in them. If they exhibit great fortitude and defiance, his interest is piqued—even more so if the character displays uncommon knowledge or beauty. Such a person might not be worthy to succeed him, but the man or woman might provide amusement to Strahd as a new possession.<br><br><h3>Roleplaying Strahd</h3>Strahd believes his soul is lost to evil. He feels neither pity nor remorse, neither love nor hate. He doesn’t suffer anguish or wallow in indignation. He believes, and has always believed, that he is the master of his own fate.<br><br>When he was alive, Strahd could admit to letting his emotions get the better of him from time to time. Now, as a vampire, he is more monster than man, with barely a hint of emotion left. He is above the concerns of the living. The only event that occasionally haunts him is the death of Tatyana, but his view of the past is bereft of romance or regret. In his mind, her death couldn’t have been prevented, and what is done cannot be undone.<br><br>In life, Strahd lived to conquer. In undeath, he conquers still—not realms, but people, driving good souls to become corrupt and destroying those who won’t yield. Characters who try to appeal to Strahd’s humanity will be gravely disappointed, because there is little humanity left in him. If they ask Strahd why he’s preying on Ireena Kolyana, he tells them that Ireena’s body is the host for Tatyana’s soul, and Tatyana’s soul belongs to him.<br><br>Strahd can be seductive and subtle when he chooses to be, especially if a person is clever or attractive. Men and women of beauty and cunning amuse Strahd for a time—playthings to possess or discard as he desires.<br><br>If he senses a lack of cohesion in a party of adventurers, he preys on that weakness and tries to drive a wedge between the characters by promising to help one at the expense of another. If Strahd senses evil in a person, he cultivates that tendency by offering to turn that character into a full-fledged vampire after helping Strahd destroy the rest of the party. Ultimately, Strahd doesn’t honor his promise, instead turning the character into a vampire spawn under his control.<br><br><h3>When Strahd Attacks</h3>Strahd isn’t a villain who remains out of sight until the final scene. Far from it—he travels as he desires to any place in his realm or his castle, and (from his perspective) the more often he encounters the characters, the better. The characters can and should meet him multiple times before the final encounter, which most likely takes place in the location determined by the card reading. His combat details are available in his <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTZiYzA5N2ViNTZi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>stat block</a>.<br><br>When Strahd wants to terrorize the characters, he pays them a visit, either under the cloak of night or beneath overcast skies during the day. If they’re indoors, he tries to charm or goad a character into inviting him inside (along with his vampire spawn, if they are present). Strahd and his minions never attack Ireena.<br><br>These encounters are meant to test the characters, not kill them. After a few rounds of toying with them, Strahd and his creatures withdraw. If the characters retreat, Strahd is likely to allow them to flee, savoring their fear and believing he has broken them.<br></section>","img":""}

He wants to be free of Barovia’s curse but sees no hope of escape.<br><br><h4>Bones of St. Andral</h4>Until recently, the church was protected from Strahd’s depredations by the bones of St. Andral, which were sealed in a crypt beneath the church’s main altar. But now the church is at risk because someone broke into the crypt a few nights ago and stole the bones. Until recently, Father Lucian was the only person in Vallaki who knew about the bones, but he recalls mentioning them to Yeska over a month ago to put the fearful boy at ease. After the bones were stolen, Father Lucian asked Yeska if he told anyone else about the bones. The boy nodded but wouldn’t divulge a name.<br><br>\nThe culprit is Milivoj, whom Father Lucian correctly suspects. But the priest has been reluctant to confront Milivoj because the lad is so temperamental. Father Lucian has not reported the theft for fear of the distress that the news might cause, and he doesn’t want to ruin the burgomaster’s festival. If the party includes a good-aligned cleric or paladin, Father Lucian mentions the theft in the hope that the characters can provide assistance.<br><br>\nSt. Andral’s crypt is a 10-foot-square, 5-foot high chamber beneath the chapel. To reach the crypt, Milivoj used his shovel to pry up the chapel floorboards. (The boards have since been replaced.) If one of the characters confronts Milivoj and succeeds on a DC 10 Charisma (Intimidation) check, he admits that Yeska told him about the bones. He also admits to passing along the information to <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MmZlMGUyNDcwYWE2 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Henrik van der Voort</a>, the local coffin maker (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MWQ3Zjc2OTNmNmYx ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Coffin Maker's Shop</a>), and to stealing the bones for Henrik in return for money to help feed his younger sisters and brothers.<br><br>\nThe theft of the bones has left the church vulnerable to attack by Strahd’s minions (see \"St. Andral's Feast\" in the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=N2M0MmM5ZjE3Mzdj ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Special Events: Chapter 5</a> handout).

It is owned by a middle-aged married couple, Gunther and Yelena Arasek (LG male and female <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OWYxMjNkNjFkMTdj ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>commoners</a></strong>).

If the characters approach the wagon, read:<br><br><blockquote>The wagon suddenly lurches, as though something big has thrown itself against the inside wall. You hear the cracking of wood, the scraping of metal, and the snarl of something inhuman. Upon closer inspection, you see that the sides of the wagon are spattered with dry blood. You also see an inscription on the wagon’s door frame that reads, “I bring you from Shadow into Light!”</blockquote><br>Rictavio carries the key to the wagon door. The lock can be picked but is rigged with a <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NzRmYTIzZGNjYjZi ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>poison needle trap</a>.<br><br>\nInside the wagon is a <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NGVhMzI0YTQ0ZWJj ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i><strong>armored saber-toothed tiger</strong></a><strong>.</strong> It is clad in specially fitted half plate and has been trained to hunt evil <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NzAzZjc4MGFjNWZk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Vistani</a>. The tiger recognizes Vistani by smell and, to a lesser extent, by the fancy garb they wear.<br><br>The wagon also contains the torn-up remains of a doll. A character who makes a successful DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check discovers that the doll was once a colorfully dressed Vistani effigy. Stitched into its tattered pants is a slogan: “Is No Fun, Is No Blinsky!”<br><br>\nRictavio isn’t ready to unleash the tiger on the Vistani just yet. He feeds it by dropping wolf steaks down a 1-foot-square hatch in the wagon’s roof. A character who climbs atop the wagon can spot the hatch without needing to make an ability check.<br><br>\nIf the tiger is released, it begins stalking through the streets until its keen sense of smell locates either <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MTY5MmZlODgzNzJi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Rictavio</a> (area N2) or <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YzU3ZmVhZmU5ZDIx ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Piccolo</a> (area N7). The tiger doesn’t attack anyone who isn’t a Vistana except in self-defense. It attacks Vistani on sight. Rictavio can make the tiger break off its attack and lure it back into the wagon.<br><br><h4>Treasure</h4>The front seat of the wagon conceals a secret compartment that requires a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to find and open. The compartment holds several items:<br><br><ul><li>An unlocked wooden coffer containing 50 ep bearing Strahd’s profile and six gemstones (worth 100 gp each)</li><li>A small prayer book (worth 50 gp) with a green leather cover and indecipherable notes in the margins</li><li>A healer’s kit</li><li>Three wooden holy symbols inlaid with silver and in the shape of a sunburst (worth 50 gp each)</li><li>A silvered shortsword</li><li>A hand crossbow inlaid with mother-of-pearl (worth 250 gp)</li><li>A bundle of twenty silvered crossbow bolts</li><li>A worn leather case with gold buckles (worth 100 gp) containing three sharpened wooden stakes, a sack of garlic, a jar of salt, a box of holy wafers, six vials of holy water, a polished steel mirror, and a bone scroll tube with a silver stopper and chain (worth 25 gp). The tube contains a <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MTE4ZDc2ZGNkMWQ3 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>spell scroll</a></em> of <em>protection from fiends</em> and a <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MTE4ZDc2ZGNkMWQ3 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>spell scroll</a></em> of <em>protection from undead</em></li></ul><h4><span style=\"color: rgb( 99 , 36 , 35 )\">Fortunes of Ravenloft</span></h4>If your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it is hidden with the other items under the front seat of the wagon, in a lead-lined box.<br><br><hr><br><h3>N6.

Blinsky Toys</h3><blockquote>This cramped shop has a dark entrance portico, above which hangs a wooden sign shaped like a rocking horse, with a “B” engraved on both sides. Flanking the entrance are two arched, lead-framed windows. Through the dirty glass, you see jumbled displays of toys and hanging placards bearing the slogan “Is No Fun, Is No Blinsky!”</blockquote><br>Vallaki’s toymaker,<strong> <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZDIzZTc1OWM5YTAz ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Gadof Blinsky</a></strong><strong> </strong>(CG male human), calls himself “a wizard of tiny wonders,” but he has been consumed by despair lately because no one seems to like him or want his toys. His fascination for eerie playthings causes most other locals to avoid him. The burgomaster enables Blinsky to stay in business by giving him a couple of gold pieces a month to make festival decorations.<br><br>\nBlinsky is a heavyset man who wears a moth-eaten jester’s cap during store hours, more out of habit than to humor visitors. In the past six months, the only paying customer who has set foot in the store is a visitor from a faraway land named Rictavio (see <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=N2VhNzc0NDhlZmVi ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Blue Water Inn</a>), who came in two weeks ago and bought a stuffed Vistana doll. Realizing that the toymaker was lonely, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MTY5MmZlODgzNzJi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Rictavio</a> gave Blinsky his pet monkey, <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YzU3ZmVhZmU5ZDIx ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Piccolo</a></strong>. Overjoyed, Blinsky has begun training the monkey to fetch toys from hard-to-reach shelves. The toymaker has also fitted Piccolo with a custom-tailored ballerina tutu.<br><br>\nWhen he meets new customers, Blinsky recites a well-rehearsed greeting: “Wyelcome, friends, to the House of Blinsky, where hyappiness and smiles can be bought at bargain prices. Perhaps you know a leetle child in need of joy? A leetle toy for a girl or boy?”<br><br><h4>Creepy Toys</h4>Blinsky believes the burgomaster is right—that the only way to escape from Barovia is to make everyone in town “hyappy.” Blinsky would like to do his part by making sure that all the children in Barovia have fun toys. On display are a few of his creations:<br><br><ul><li>A headless doll that comes with a sack of attachable heads, including one with its eyes and mouth stitched shut (price 9 cp)</li><li>A miniature gallows, complete with trapdoor and a weighted “hanged man” (price 9 cp)</li><li>A set of wooden nesting dolls; the smaller each one gets, the older it gets, until the innermost doll is a mummified corpse (price 9 cp)</li><li>A wood-and-string mobile of hanging bats with flapping wings (price 9 cp)</li><li>A wind-up musical merry-go-round with figures of snarling wolves chasing children in place of prancing horses (price 9 sp)</li><li>A ventriloquist’s dummy that looks like Strahd von Zarovich (price 9 sp)</li><li>A doll that looks remarkably like <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YjY2YzRmODJjYmNl ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Ireena Kolyana</a> (not for sale; see below)</li></ul>\n<strong><em>Ireena Kolyana Dolls. </em></strong>Blinsky makes special dolls for the burgomaster’s henchman, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OWI0OGEwMDg5M2Qy ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Izek Strazni</a> (see <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MmIxNGM4MWU0NTk0 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area N3</a>). Izek doesn’t pay for the dolls but instead threatens to burn down Blinsky’s shop unless the toymaker delivers a new doll every month. Every doll is modeled on a description given to Blinsky by Izek, and each doll has been closer to capturing Ireena’s likeness than the last. Blinsky doesn’t know that the doll is meant to be modeled after anyone in particular. If Ireena is with the party, however, Blinsky realizes that she is the inspiration for Izek’s dolls.<br><br>\n<strong><em>Von Weerg’s Masterpiece.</em></strong> Blinsky considers himself a student of a great inventor and toymaker named Fritz von Weerg. Blinsky has heard rumors that von Weerg’s greatest invention—a clockwork man—lies somewhere in Castle Ravenloft. If the characters seem intent on going there, Blinsky asks if they would be so kind as to find the clockwork “myasterpiece” and “dyeliver” it to him, in exchange for which Blinsky offers to make them any toy they desire. Because “byusiness” has not been good, he says, he has no other reward to offer except, perhaps, his new monkey companion.<br><br><hr><br><h3>N8. Town Square</h3><blockquote>The shops and homes that enclose the town square are decorated with limp, tattered garlands and painted wooden boxes filled with tiny, dead flowers. At the north end of the square stands a row of stocks, locked in which are several men, women, and children wearing crude, plaster donkey heads.<br><br>\nIn the center of the square, peasants in patchwork clothes eye you suspiciously as they use cups and vases to draw water from a crumbling stone fountain. Standing tall at the center of the fountain is a gray statue of an impressive man facing west. All around the square are posted proclamations:</blockquote><br><blockquote style=\"text-align: center\">\nCome one, come all,<br>\nto the greatest celebration of the year:<br>\nTHE WOLF’S HEAD JAMBOREE!<br>\nAttendance and children required.<br>\nPikes will be provided.<br>\nALL WILL BE WELL!<br>\n— The Baron —</blockquote><br>When the characters read this proclamation, reveal <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YjRkNmJiZGI4ZjRj ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Handout: Vallaki Proclamation Wolf's Head Jamboree</a>.<br><br>The Wolf’s Head Jamboree has already occurred, making the square’s proclamations out of date. If the characters linger, they see the burgomaster’s henchman, <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OWI0OGEwMDg5M2Qy ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Izek Strazni</a></strong>, arrive with two town <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NGVjOTU0NmM3ODMy ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>guards</a></strong>. Izek orders one guard to tear down all of the old proclamations while the other posts the following new one:<br><br><blockquote style=\"text-align: center\">COME ONE, COME ALL,<br>\nto the greatest celebration of the year:<br>\nTHE FESTIVAL OF THE BLAZING SUN!<br>\nAttendance and children required.<br>\nRain or shine.<br>\nALL WILL BE WELL!<br>\n— The Baron —</blockquote><br>When the characters see this proclamation, reveal <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NDU2YmRmOTQ2OTU3 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Handout: Vallaki Proclamation Festival Of The Blazing Sun</a>.<br><br>Most Vallakians have no idea whom the statue in the square represents. The burgomaster claims it is Boris Vallakovich, his ancestor and the town’s founder, but there’s no noticeable family resemblance.<br><br><h4>Donkey-Headed Criminals</h4>The townsfolk in the stocks were arrested for “malicious unhappiness” (spreading negative opinions about the upcoming festival). An iron padlock secures each set of stocks, and Izek Strazni carries the keys on an iron ring.<br><br>\nThree men, two women, and two boys are trapped in the stocks—all of them tired, wet, and famished. The five adults have the statistics of human <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OWYxMjNkNjFkMTdj ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>commoners</a></strong>, and the children are noncombatants. The plaster donkey heads they wear are meant to encourage ridicule.<br><br>\nFreeing one or more prisoners without the baron’s consent is a crime. If the characters are witnessed doing so, Izek rallies the town <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NGVjOTU0NmM3ODMy ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>guards</a></strong> (twenty-four in all) and orders the characters to leave town at once or suffer the consequences. If the characters stand their ground, Izek orders the guards to beat them into submission, seize their weapons, and cast them out of Vallaki to be “food for the wolves.”<br><br>\nIf the characters are exiled from Vallaki without their weapons, the Keepers of the Feather (see <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=N2VhNzc0NDhlZmVi ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Blue Water Inn</a>) snatch the party’s belongings from under Izek’s nose and see them safely returned to the characters.<br><br>\nIf the guards fall to waylay the characters, Izek (if he’s still around) flees to the burgomaster’s mansion, giving the characters the run of the town. The townsfolk lock themselves in their homes, fearful that the characters aim to murder them.<br><br><hr>\n<br><h3>N9.

Three sober Vistani (CN male and female human <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OGE3MjEyZjM1YzAy ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i><strong>vistani bandit captains</strong></a>) are resting in three of the four wagons but leap quickly into action if an alarm is raised.<br><br>Although the Vistani in this camp are in league with Strahd, they attack only if the characters provoke them with threats or insults. Otherwise, the characters are offered flasks of wine and invited to join the reverie.<br><br>If the characters linger at the camp, continue with “A Vistana’s Tale” below. If they seem in a hurry to leave, one of the Vistani tells them, “It was fated that you would visit our humble camp. Madam Eva foretold your coming. She awaits you.” The Vistana then points to the largest tent. If the characters head that way, continue with “Madam Eva’s Tent.”<br><br><h4>A Vistana’s Tale</h4>If the characters linger by the fire, one of the Vistani recounts the following tale:<br><br><blockquote>“A mighty wizard came to this land over a year ago. I remember him like it was yesterday. He stood exactly where you’re standing. A very charismatic man, he was. He thought he could rally the people of Barovia against the devil Strahd. He stirred them with thoughts of revolt and bore them to the castle en masse.<br><br>“When the vampire appeared, the wizard’s peasant army fled in terror. A few stood their ground and were never seen again.<br><br>“The wizard and the vampire cast spells at each other. Their battle flew from the courtyards of Ravenloft to a precipice overlooking the falls. I saw the battle with my own eyes. Thunder shook the mountainside, and great rocks tumbled down upon the wizard, yet by his magic he survived. Lightning from the heavens struck the wizard, and again he stood his ground. But when the devil Strahd fell upon him, the wizard’s magic couldn’t save him. I saw him thrown a thousand feet to his death. I climbed down to the river to search for the wizard’s body, to see if, you know, he had anything of value, but the River Ivlis had already spirited him away.”</blockquote><br>The Vistana storyteller doesn’t remember the wizard’s name, but recalls that it sounded important. If the characters haven’t spoken with Madam Eva, the storyteller urges them to do so.<br><br><h4>Madam Eva’s Tent</h4>If the characters decide to see <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZGZiYWVmNjcxZGVm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Madam Eva</a>, read:<br><br><blockquote>Magic flames cast a reddish glow over the interior of this tent, revealing a low table covered in a black velvet cloth. Glints of light seem to flash from a crystal ball on the table as a hunched figure peers into its depths. As the crone speaks, her voice crackles like dry weeds. “At last you have arrived!” Cackling laughter bursts like mad lightning from her withered lips.</blockquote><br><strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZGZiYWVmNjcxZGVm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Madam Eva</a></strong> speaks the name of each party member and makes some reference to that individual’s past deeds. She then asks the characters if they want their fortunes read. If they say yes, Madam Eva produces a worn deck of cards and proceeds with the sequence outlined in chapter 1. (If the characters don’t want a reading of their fates, continue play using the card reading you performed before starting the adventure.)<br><br>Madam Eva might seem mad, but she is, in fact, cunning and sharp of mind. She has met a good many adventurers in her time and knows they can’t be fully trusted. She wants to free the land of Barovia from its curse, and her fate is interwoven with Strahd’s (see the Madam Eva bio &amp; info of her character sheet). She does the vampire’s bidding when called upon and does nothing to anger Strahd or bring harm to the Vistani. She never gives aid and never asks for any.<br><br><h4>Treasure</h4>For each Vistani tent or wagon that the characters search, roll once on the following table to determine what treasure is found:<br><br><table style=\"font-size: 13px\"><tbody><tr><td><strong>d20</strong></td><td><strong>Treasure</strong></td></tr><tr><td>1-10</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>11-13</td><td>Sack of 100 ep (each coin stamped with Strahd’s visage in profile)</td></tr><tr><td>14-16</td><td>Pouch containing 4d6 gemstones worth 100 gp each</td></tr><tr><td>17-19</td><td>Sack containing 3d6 pieces of cheap jewelry worth 25 gp total and 1d6 pieces of fine jewelry worth 250 gp each</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>One magic item (roll once on <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZjI2YTQ3MTgyZjBm ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Magic Item Table B</a>)</td></tr></tbody></table><br><h4><span style=\"color: rgb( 99 , 0 , 0 )\">Fortunes of Ravenloft</span></h4>If your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it is hidden in one of the Vistani wagons.

When the trap is sprung, two steel portcullises drop from the ceiling at lightning speed to seal off the compartment, trapping within those creatures that triggered the trap. An instant later, the closed-off elevator is propelled up the western half of a 20-foot-wide, 170-foot-tall shaft (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=Yjc3NTVkZDRiZmEz ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K31a</a>) to the sounds of turning gears and rattling chains. Magic sleep gas fills the compartment as it rises, and a creature trapped inside must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or fall unconscious as though affected by a <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=MzYxMTNlOWJjMTQ0 ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>sleep</a></em> spell.<br><br>At the same time the elevator rises, a 10-foot cube of granite suspended from heavy chains descends in the eastern half of the shaft, acting as a counterweight. The massive block lands gently at the bottom of the shaft, filling the previously open 10-foot-by-10-foot space adjacent to where the elevator stood. The block weighs thousands of tons and pulverizes anything in the space where it comes to rest.<br><br>Once the elevator starts rising, its portcullises are locked in place and can’t be lifted. The walls of the shaft are nearly flush with the elevator compartment; only a few inches of space exist between the portcullises and the shaft walls.<br><br>All creatures trapped inside the elevator (including unconscious ones) must roll initiative. The compartment takes 1 round to reach the top of the shaft, stopping just beneath <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=M2JjYzQ4NTk1NjM1 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K47</a>. Each creature inside has one turn to act before the compartment comes to a dead stop. Their initiative rolls determine the order in which the occupants act. Conscious party members can take whatever actions they like. They might search for a way out, wake sleeping party members, cast spells, or take other actions. Unconscious ones can do nothing.<br><br>A character who uses an action to search the ceiling of the elevator finds a secret trapdoor with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check. The trapdoor opens downward.<br><br>Any creature on top of the elevator when it reaches the top of the shaft must make a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw to avoid being crushed against the ceiling of the shaft. The character takes 44 (8d10) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. When the elevator comes to a stop, its portcullises retract.<br><br>The elevator remains at the top of the shaft until the lever in <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=Yjc3NTVkZDRiZmEz ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K31</a> is moved to the “down” position. When that happens, the trap resets in 1 round: the portcullises come down, and the elevator compartment descends to its place in the hallway at the bottom of the shaft as the stone block rises to the top of the shaft. When the elevator reaches the bottom, its portcullises rise again.<br><br><h4>Development</h4>The sound of the elevator moving can be heard throughout the castle. Characters who are trapped or asleep in the elevator compartment are easy prey for <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTZiYzA5N2ViNTZi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Strahd</a>, who can reach them by way of the trapdoor in <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=M2JjYzQ4NTk1NjM1 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K47</a>.<br><br><hr><br><h3>K62. Servants’ Hall</h3><blockquote>This hall stands in deadly silence. Heavy beams support a sagging, ten-foot-high ceiling. Fog clings to the floor, obscuring everything that lies less than three feet above it. A giant shadow lurches across the ceiling as a dark figure shuffles purposefully down the corridor toward you.</blockquote><br>The figure approaching is <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NGE3OWU5NGU0Zjli ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Cyrus Belview</a></strong>, a mongrelfolk and Strahd’s faithful servant. He stands 4 feet, 9 inches tall but appears shorter because of his hunched posture. He has the Keen Hearing and Smell feature. The left side his face is covered with lizard scales, and he has the ears of a panther. His left foot looks like a duck’s webbed foot, and his arms have patches of black dog fur.<br><br>The light in the hall comes from a lantern on the floor behind Cyrus. If the characters have their own light sources, Cyrus sees them, but he will not attack first. He wears a loop of twine around his neck, hanging from which is an iron key and a decorative wooden pendant fitted with a varnished human eyeball. The key unlocks the iron chest in <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=M2JjYzQ4NTk1NjM1 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K60</a>. The wooden pendant is a <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZTE0NjhhYmRmOWQz ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>hag eye</a></em> given to Cyrus by the night hag <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YzcyZDg2NWNjYTZi ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Morgantha</a>, so that she could spy on Strahd. Cyrus doesn’t know that the necklace is magical.<br><br>Poor old Cyrus is obviously crazy. He has served the master for uncounted years and is devoted to him. Cyrus tries to get the characters to retire to their “room in the tower” (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=M2JjYzQ4NTk1NjM1 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K49</a>). If the characters aren’t sure what room he is talking about, he offers to lead them there.<br><br>If the characters follow Cyrus, he tells them to stay close to him as he leads them through the south door to <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YWUwMjk4ZDM0NDI1 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K61</a> and deliberately sets off the elevator trap there. Cyrus tries his best not to succumb to the sleeping gas as the elevator compartment climbs the shaft (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=Yjc3NTVkZDRiZmEz ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K31</a>), and he has advantage on the saving throw. Assuming he’s still conscious when the elevator compartment reaches the top of the shaft, Cyrus opens the trapdoor to <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=M2JjYzQ4NTk1NjM1 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K47</a> and either leads the characters to <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=M2JjYzQ4NTk1NjM1 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K49</a> or, if they’re unconscious, drags them there. After assuring characters who are conscious that “the master will be along shortly,” Cyrus then makes his way back downstairs to the kitchen (area K65).<br><br>If the characters don’t go to their room, Cyrus shakes his head and returns to the work of preparing his dinner in <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YWUwMjk4ZDM0NDI1 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K65</a>. If the characters take his key, he screams, “The master will not be pleased!” and begins to moan and slap his head, obviously upset. A successful DC 10 Charisma (Intimidation) check is enough to make him divulge the key’s purpose, the location of the iron chest, and the chest’s contents.<br><br>When he isn’t being threatened, Cyrus giggles to himself from time to time for no clear reason. He also likes to tell poor jokes at the most inopportune moments.<br><br>Stairs at the east end of the north wall lead up to <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZmU0Yjk2NzNiY2U4 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K23</a>.<br><br>Along the east wall is a rusted but sturdy iron portcullis that bars the way to area K63. (If the characters peer through the portcullis, read the boxed text for area K63.) The portcullis bars are 1 inch thick and spaced 4 inches apart. The portcullis can be lifted with a successful DC 20 Strength check.<br><br>The double doors at the west end of the hall are made of heavy planks banded with steel. They open into area K67.<br><br><hr><br><h3>K63. Wine Cellar</h3><blockquote>Arched frames of stone form a low, wet ceiling over this wine cellar. Great casks line the walls, their bands rusting and their contents long since spilled onto the floor. A few hungry rats make their home here, but upon your sudden arrival, they retreat to the shadows.</blockquote><br>The rats are harmless. <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NGE3OWU5NGU0Zjli ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Cyrus Belview</a> (see area K62) treats them like pets.<br><br>Characters who search the room find a crack at the southern end of the west wall. The crack is half an inch wide, 5 inches tall, and 12 inches deep; it leads to <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZmU0Yjk2NzNiY2U4 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K18</a>.<br><br><h4>Wine Casks</h4>Each of the twelve large casks here rests on its side in a heavy wooden brace. Three casks stand against the north wall, six against the east wall, and three against the south wall. Decorative lettering is burned into the top of each cask, showing the winery name—the Wizard of Wines—and the name of the wine in the cask.<br><br><strong><em>Northern Casks.</em></strong> All three of these casks are rotted and empty. The wine’s name is Champagne du le Stomp.<br><br><strong><em>Eastern Casks.</em></strong> Five of these casks are rotted and empty. The wine name burned on each is Red Dragon Crush. Lining the interior of the sixth one is a patch of <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZWQ0NjFhZTlhN2Fl ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>yellow mold</a>. A character who inspects the cask closely and succeeds on a DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check sees yellow mold in the cracks between the planks of the cask. If this cask is smashed open, the yellow mold releases a cloud of spores.<br><br><strong><em>Southern Casks.</em></strong> Two of these casks are rotted and empty. The wine name burned on each is Purple Grapemash No. 3. The middle one is home to a purplish <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MjVlODYyNzNjYzQx ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>black pudding</a></strong> that bursts forth if the cask is broken open.<br><br><h4><span style=\"color: rgb( 99 , 36 , 35 )\">Fortunes of Ravenloft</span></h4>If your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it is inside one of the empty casks along the north wall, hidden there by <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NGE3OWU5NGU0Zjli ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Cyrus Belview</a>.<br><br><hr><br><h3>K64. Guards’ Stair</h3><blockquote>The long, hollow sigh of the wind breathes a semblance of life into this otherwise featureless staircase. </blockquote><br>The stairway starts at area K68 and goes up past <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZmU0Yjk2NzNiY2U4 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K13</a> to <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZTM3NDAwZGFhNGE5 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K46</a>.<br><br><hr><br><h3>K65. Kitchen</h3><blockquote>A horrible odor of decay fills this steaming hot room. A huge pot bubbles over a blazing fire pit in the center of the room, its green, muddy contents churning. The far wall is lined with pegs, hanging from which are numerous large cooking implements—some of which could easily double as implements of torture.</blockquote><br>If a character looks into the pot, three human <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=M2JhZmNmMzE0MDdj ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>zombies</a></strong> rise up from the bubbling depths and attack. The zombies are slowly being boiled to death, and each has only 13 hit points remaining. If <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NGE3OWU5NGU0Zjli ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Cyrus Belview</a> (see area K62) is present when the zombies attack, he grabs a heavy club and tries to beat them back into the pot. Cyrus explains that he just isn’t the cook he used to be, and his meals tend to get out of hand these days.<br><br><hr><br><h3>K66. Butler’s Quarters</h3><blockquote>This twenty-foot-square room is filled wall to wall with clutter. A long, sagging bed sits to one side under a huge faded tapestry that depicts Castle Ravenloft. Dusty lanterns sit in various places, and bright curtains are draped haphazardly about the room. Thousands of pieces of junk cover the floor. Broken swords, crumpled shields, and helmets lie in piles all about.</blockquote><br><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NGE3OWU5NGU0Zjli ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Cyrus Belview</a> (see area K62) uses this room as his lair. There is nothing of value here.<br><br>If Cyrus is with the party, the characters notice that he is caressing their equipment and chuckling to himself. Cyrus has been salvaging equipment from dead adventurers for years. He looks forward to adding to his collection after Strahd gets through with the characters.<br><br><hr><br><h3>K67. Hall of Bones</h3>Once a mess hall for the castle guards, this room is now <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=OTYzYWU0NjIyNmVh ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>desecrated ground</a>.<br><br><blockquote>Dark stains cover the floor of this area. Large oak tables, scarred and beaten, lay scattered like toys about the room, their wood crushed and splintered. Replacing them are furnishings made entirely of human bones.<br><br>The walls and the twenty-foot-high vaulted ceiling are a sickly yellow color, not because of faded or timeworn plaster but because they are adorned with bones and skulls arranged in a morbidly decorative fashion, giving the room a cathedral-like quality. Four enormous mounds of bones occupy the corners of this ossuary, and garlands of skulls extend from these mounds to a chandelier of bones that hangs from the ceiling above a long table constructed of bones in the center of the room. Ten chairs made of bones and festooned with decorative skulls surround the table, resting atop which is an ornate, bowl-shaped vessel made of yet more bones.<br><br>The doors to the north and south are sheathed in bone, but the steel-banded double doors in the center of the east wall are not. Above these eastern doors is mounted the skull of a dragon.</blockquote><br><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NGE3OWU5NGU0Zjli ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Cyrus Belview</a> (see area K62) created this enormous work of art out of the bones of dead servants and slain adventurers. It has taken him many years to complete it. The bones and skulls are held together with gray mortar and white paste. The dark stains on the floor are old bloodstains, caused here when Strahd hunted down and killed the remainder of his castle guards.<br><br>The dragon skull mounted above the eastern doors belonged to <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MjAzZTk5YjcxZTNk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Argynvost</a>, a silver dragon that was killed in the valley by Strahd and his army before the founding of Castle Ravenloft. The skull weighs 250 pounds.<br><br><h4><span style=\"color: rgb( 99 , 36 , 35 )\">Fortunes of Ravenloft</span></h4>If your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it is lying on the bone table.<br><br>If your card reading indicates an encounter with <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTZiYzA5N2ViNTZi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Strahd</a> in this area, he is sitting comfortably at one end of the table, holding the skull of a long-dead foe.<br><br><hr><br><h3>K68. Guards’ Run</h3><blockquote>This ten-foot-wide arched corridor is cold and moist. The cold seems to emanate from an open archway in the west wall. </blockquote><br>The archway leads to area K69. A door at the north end of the hall opens into area K67. To the south, the hallway ends at the foot of a staircase (area K64) that spirals upward.<br><br><hr><br><h3>K69. Guards’ Quarters</h3><blockquote>Sickly, yellow lichen covers the ceiling of this cold, damp, ten-foot-wide passage running east and west. Opening off both sides of this passage are ten-foot-square alcoves that contain rotting cots, rags, and the skeletal remains of castle guards. A deathly silence fills the hall.</blockquote><br>The yellow lichen is harmless. When one or more characters reach the midpoint of the hall, ten human <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OGFjZjBlMWM5YWU0 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>skeletons</a></strong> leap from the alcoves and attack.<br><br><hr><br><h3>K70. Kingsmen Hall</h3><blockquote>This thirty-foot-square room is a shambles. Scattered furniture lies in heaps near the walls. Broken bones lie scattered amid crumpled and crushed plate armor. Shields and swords jut from the walls as if driven into them by some tremendous force.<br><br>Two doors stand opposite one another in the center of the north wall and the south wall. A dark archway leads out through the east wall.</blockquote><br>After Strahd was transformed into a vampire, several of the castle guards retreated to this room, but Strahd caught them and slaughtered them in a brutal show of violence. Removing one of the shields or swords from the wall requires a successful DC 10 Strength check. None of the items found here are valuable.<br><br><hr><br><h3>K71. Kingsmen Quarters</h3><blockquote>This dark passage runs for twenty feet, connecting an archway to the west with an ascending stone staircase to the east. To the north and south are four ten-foot-square alcoves cluttered with rotting cots and dirty rags. The ceilings here are covered with yellow lichen.</blockquote><br>The yellow lichen is harmless. Beyond the archway to the west is area K70. The staircase (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZmU0Yjk2NzNiY2U4 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K20a</a>) that goes up along the east wall leads to area <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZmU0Yjk2NzNiY2U4 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>K20</a>.<br><br><h4>Treasure</h4>Three of the alcoves contain nothing of value. A loose flagstone in the southeast alcove covers a hidden cubbyhole in the floor, in which is hidden a moldy sack containing 150 ep. The coins have the profiled visage of Strahd von Zarovich stamped on them. A character who searches the alcove can find the loose flagstone with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check.<br><br><hr><br><h3>K72. Chamberlain’s Office</h3><blockquote>This shadowy room is in perfect order. A great table stands here with its chair, inkwell, and quill set carefully in place. Lances, swords, and shields that bear the Barovian crest are hung neatly on the dark, oak-paneled walls.</blockquote><br>If he has not been defeated elsewhere, <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=M2NlY2IzOWI5Nzhi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Rahadin</a></strong> is here, waiting for the characters to arrive so he can kill them.<br><br>A <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZDNkZTBkODNiYjlj ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>shadow demon</a></strong> also haunts this room. In the round after the characters engage Rahadin, the demon leaps out and attacks the nearest character from behind. The character doesn’t notice the demon, unless the character’s passive Wisdom (Perception) score meets or exceeds the demon’s Dexterity (Stealth) check. Both Rahadin and the shadow demon fight until slain.<br><br>A secret door is set into the north end of the west wall. It can be pulled open to reveal a dusty, web-choked staircase of ancient, worn stone (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YzI0YTFjYTVjY2Jh ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K79</a>) that descends into darkness.<br></section>","img":"modules/cor-cos/journal/004_-_Chapter_4_3A_Castle_Ravenloft/008_-_Map_11_3A_Larders_of_Ill_Omen/avatar.webp"}

Bildrath’s Mercantile</h3><blockquote>The sparse light from this building spills out from behind drawn heavy curtains. A sign over the door, creaking on its hinges, reads “Bildrath’s Mercantile.”</blockquote><br>The establishment is 70 feet long by 40 feet wide. The owner, Bildrath Cantemir (LN male human <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OWYxMjNkNjFkMTdj ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>commoner</a></strong>), sells items from the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MjNjMzQzYmU0NDgx ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Adventuring Gear</a> table, but only items with a price lower than 25 gp in the table, and he sells them for ten times the price.<br><br>Bildrath trades with the Vistani when they pass through. He is also happy to make a profit from any strangers unlucky enough to find themselves here. He serves his own interests and offers no sanctuary. He never bargains since, as he says, “If you want it badly enough, you’ll pay for it.” He has no competition in the village.<br><br>If the characters give Bildrath a hard time, he calls <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MTc5ZTRmZGFjZmJk ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Parriwimple</a></strong> (LG male human), his nephew and stock-boy, to help him out. Parriwimple’s real name is Parpol Cantemir, but no one in the village calls him that. His muscles rippling beneath his leather tunic should give ample notice of his strength. At the same time, Parriwimple is simple-minded. He is devoted to his uncle and will not follow the characters as long as Bildrath has something to say about it.<br><hr><br><h3>E2. Blood of the Vine Tavern</h3><blockquote>A single shaft of light thrusts illumination into the main square, its brightness looking like a solid pillar in the heavy fog. Above the gaping doorway, a sign hangs precariously askew, proclaiming this to be the Blood on the Vine tavern.</blockquote><br>The tavern building is about 60 feet square. Close inspection of the sign reveals that it originally read “Blood of the Vine.” (An “n” has been scratched over with the “f.”) This once finely appointed tavern has grown shoddy over the years. A blazing fire in the hearth gives scant warmth to the few huddled souls within. They include the barkeep, three <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NzAzZjc4MGFjNWZk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Vistani</a> sitting together, and a man named Ismark Kol­yanovich—who happens to be the son of the village burgomaster, Kolyan Indirovich.<br><br><h4>Roleplaying Ismark</h4><strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OTc3YTUzMjU0Njc3 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Ismark Kolyanovich</a> </strong>(LG male human) is a young man who sits by himself at a corner table, sipping his wine. Other villagers call him “Ismark the Lesser” because he has lived in the shadow of his father for most of his life.<br><br>Ismark isn’t a typically dour Barovian. He invites the characters to join him, offers to pay for their wine, and asks for their aid in protecting his adopted sister, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YjY2YzRmODJjYmNl ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Ireena Kolyana</a>. If they agree to help, he takes them to the burgomaster’s residence (area E4). He wants the characters to help him escort Ireena to Vallaki, a settlement in the heart of the valley, beyond the view of Castle Ravenloft and (he hopes) beyond the reach of Strahd. Ismark knows that moving Ireena is a gamble, since she’s vulnerable to Strahd when she is outside their home, but he has heard assertions that Vallaki is well defended.<br><br>Ismark is as tight-lipped as any of the other Barovian villagers, unless the talk deals with Ireena or Strahd. Ismark knows everything the other villagers know. He also knows that, for some unknown reason, Strahd is attracted to Ireena and desires her above all others.<br><br>If you used the “<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=N2I4YzYxOGRmZmI2 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Plea for Help</a>” adventure hook and the characters show Ismark the letter they received, he knows the burgomaster’s handwriting well enough to confirm that the letter was not written by his father.<br><br>Ismark has spent most of his adult life training with weapons in the hope of one day confronting and killing Strahd. If the characters suggest that he accompany them, Ismark agrees provided that Ireena is first taken to a place of safety. As long as Ismark accompanies the characters, he acts as a party member for the purpose of determining each character’s share of experience points (though he gains no experience points himself).<br><br><h4>Roleplaying the Other NPCs</h4>Use the following information to roleplay the other NPCs in the tavern.<br><br><strong><em>Arik the Barkeep.</em></strong> A pudgy little man named Arik Lorensk (CN male human<strong> <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OWYxMjNkNjFkMTdj ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>commoner</a></strong>) tends bar. Mindlessly, he cleans glasses, one after another. When they’re all clean, he starts over. If he is spoken to, he takes orders for drinks in a dull, hollow voice. A small glass of wine costs 1 cp. A pitcher of wine costs 1 sp. After serving drinks, Arik returns to cleaning glasses. He ignores all attempts to question him.<br><br><strong><em>Vistani Owners.</em></strong> Three <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YTgxNmU2Y2E0MTZj ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i><strong>Vistani spies</strong></a> (N female humans) named Alenka, Mirabel, and Sorvia sit at a table near the front door. They own the tavern and see to it that all customers pay their tabs. They otherwise show little interest in the characters.<br><br>If the characters arrive in the company of other Vistani, the owners are much more likely to engage them in conversation and provide useful information. They suggest that the characters visit <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZGZiYWVmNjcxZGVm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Madam Eva</a> (see chapter 2, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NDFhNjJjZDAyMGU3 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area G</a>) to have their fortunes read.<br><br><hr><br><h3>E3. Mad Mary’s Townhouse</h3><blockquote>A moaning sob floats through the still, gray streets, coloring your thoughts with sadness. The sounds flow from a dark, two-story townhouse.</blockquote><br>The house, which is about 40 feet square, is boarded up and barricaded from the inside. <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTA5MDk2ZmUzZjcx ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Mad Mary</a></strong> (CN female human) sits in the center of the floor in an upstairs bedroom, clutching a malformed doll. She is lost in her sorrow and despondency. She barely recognizes the presence of anyone in the room. She says nothing in the presence of anger, but she will talk, albeit haltingly, to someone who talks with her gently.<br><br>Mary hid her beloved daughter, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OGZmNTAyNDdlNmZk ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Gertruda</a>, in this house for the girl’s entire life. Gertruda, now a teenager, broke out of the house a week ago and has not been seen since. Her mother fears the worst—and is justified in doing so. See <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NDFhNjJjZDAyMGU3 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K42</a> in chapter 4 for more information on Gertruda’s fate.<br><br>The malformed doll has a strange leer and wears a sackcloth dress. It belonged to Mary in her youth and was passed down to Gertruda. <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZDIzZTc1OWM5YTAz ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Gadof Blinsky</a>, the toymaker of Vallaki (see chapter 5, area N7), made the doll. Stitched into the hem of its dress is a frayed tag bearing the words “Is No Fun, Is No Blinsky!”<br><hr><br><h3>E4. Burgomaster’s Mansion</h3><blockquote>A weary-looking mansion squats behind a rusting iron fence. The iron gates are twisted and torn. The right gate lies cast aside, while the left swings lazily in the wind. The stuttering squeal and clang of the gate repeats with mindless precision. Weeds choke the grounds and press with menace upon the house itself. Yet, against the walls, the growth has been tramped down to create a path all about the domain. Heavy claw markings have stripped the once-beautiful finish of the walls. Great black marks tell of the fires that have assailed the mansion. Not a pane nor a shard of glass stands in any window. All the windows are barred with planks, each one marked with stains of evil omen.</blockquote><br>Characters who survey the grounds can, with a successful DC 11 Wisdom (Perception) check, discern trampled weeds all around the mansion as well as scores of wolf paw prints and human footprints. The footprints were made by zombies and ghouls under Strahd’s control.<br><br><strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YjY2YzRmODJjYmNl ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Ireena Kolyana</a></strong> (LG female human), the adopted daughter of the burgomaster, is inside the mansion and won’t open the heavily barred door to anyone unless she is convinced that those outside her door have no allegiance to Strahd. If the characters convince her, either with good roleplaying or a successful DC 15 Charisma (Deception or Persuasion) check, or if Ismark is with them, she opens the door and invites them in.<br><br>If the characters enter the mansion, read:<br><br><blockquote>The interior of the mansion is well furnished, yet the fixtures show signs of great wear. Noticeable oddities are the boarded-up windows and the presence of holy symbols in every room. The burgomaster is in a side drawing room on the floor—lying in a simple wooden coffin surrounded by wilting flowers and a faint odor of decay.</blockquote><br>Ismark and Ireena made the coffin themselves.<br><br><h4>Roleplaying Ireena</h4>Ireena, a striking young woman with auburn hair, has been bitten twice by Strahd. The villagers are afraid of her and avoid her. The characters are Ireena’s best hope for protection, so she is willing to accompany them under certain conditions. Although she appears mild, she has a strong will, and she aids the party as best she can in saving herself. She doesn’t remember her early past. She doesn’t know how she came to Barovia or where she came from. Moreover, her encounters with Strahd are fuzzy memories, thanks to his vampiric charm, but she can recall clearly the blazing hunger in his eyes.<br><br>She tells the characters that wolves and other terrible creatures attacked the house night after night for weeks. The burgomaster’s heart couldn’t stand the constant assault, and he died three days ago. Strangely, since his death, the house has not come under attack.<br><br>She says that no one from the village has been brave enough to help Ismark take Kolyan Indirovich to the cemetery for proper burial. Ireena asks the characters if they would be so kind as to help Ismark deliver her father’s body safely to <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZjIxMDYwN2RhZjcx ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Donavich</a>, the local priest (area E5). She refuses to be taken to Vallaki or anywhere else while the burgomaster lies dead on the mansion floor.<br><hr><br><h3>E5. Church</h3><em>(The information below is also presented in the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NDJiYjA5YTE0MjJl ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Church</a> handout for convenience. Please navigate your players to the Church Map as well.)</em><br><br><blockquote>Atop a slight rise, against the roots of the pillar stone that supports Castle Ravenloft, stands a gray, sagging edifice of stone and wood. This church has obviously weathered the assaults of evil for centuries on end and is worn and weary. A bell tower rises toward the back, and flickering light shines through holes in the shingled roof. The rafters strain feebly against their load.</blockquote><br>If the characters approach the church doors, add:<br><br><blockquote>The heavy wooden doors of the church are covered with claw marks and scarred by fire.</blockquote><br>The village priest, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZjIxMDYwN2RhZjcx ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Donavich</a>, lives here. Other Barov­ians shun the church for reasons that will quickly become obvious.<br><br>The following areas correspond to labels on the map of the church.<br><br><h4>E5a. Hall</h4><blockquote>The doors open to reveal a ten-foot-wide, twenty-foot-long hall leading to a brightly lit chapel. The hall is unlit and reeks of mildew. Four doors, two on each side of the hall, lead to adjacent chambers.<br><br>You can see that the chapel is strewn with debris, and you hear a soft voice from within reciting a prayer. Suddenly, the prayer is blotted out by an inhuman scream that rises up from beneath the wooden floor.</blockquote><br>The scream comes from the church’s undercroft (area E5g). The soft voice uttering the prayer belongs to <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZjIxMDYwN2RhZjcx ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Donavich</a>, the priest (see area E5f).<br><br><h4>E5b. Doru’s Bedroom</h4><blockquote>This dirty, lightless room contains a wooden bed with a straw-filled mattress. Mounted above the bed’s headboard is a wooden holy symbol.</blockquote><br>This room once belonged to <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YTk4Y2EzYWNiODM0 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Doru</a>, Donavich’s son, who is trapped in the undercroft (area E5g). It hasn’t been used in more than a year and contains nothing of value.<br><br><h4>E5c. Donavich’s Bedroom</h4><blockquote>This dirty room contains a wooden bed with a straw-filled mattress, next to which rests a small table with an oil lamp burning brightly on it. Mounted above the bed’s headboard is a wooden sun-shaped holy symbol. </blockquote><br>This is Donavich’s room and contains nothing of value.<br><br><h4>E5d. Trapdoor</h4><blockquote>Time and neglect have punched holes in the ceiling of this moldy room, which contains a few broken roof shingles amid puddles of water. In one corner, set into the floor, is a heavy wooden trapdoor held shut with a chain and a padlock. A young man’s screams of anguish can be heard through the door. </blockquote><br><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZjIxMDYwN2RhZjcx ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Donavich</a> lost the key to the iron padlock. If the chain is removed and the trapdoor is opened, the screaming in the undercroft stops. The trapdoor is swollen and stuck in its frame, so that a successful DC 12 Strength check is required to pull it open. Below it is a wooden staircase that descends 15 feet into the undercroft (area E5g).<br><hr><br><h3>E5e. Office</h3><blockquote>An old desk and chair stand against the south wall, a wooden holy symbol mounted above them—a sunburst. A ten-foot-long iron rod attached to the north wall stands bare, suggesting a tapestry once hung there. Against the far wall stands a wooden cabinet with four tall doors. </blockquote><br>An empty wooden poor box rests on the seat of the chair. The desk drawers contain a few sheets of blank parchment, along with a couple of quill pens and dried-up jars of ink.<br><br>For its size, the wooden cabinet contains very little. Inside are a tinderbox, a few wooden boxes full of candles, and two well-used books: <em>Hymns to the Dawn</em>, a volume of chants to the Morninglord, and <em>The Blade of Truth: The Uses of Logic in the War Against Diabolist Heresies, as Fought by the Ulmist Inquisition</em>, a strange book that mixes logic exercises with lurid descriptions of fiend-worshiping cults.<br><hr><h3>E5f. Chapel</h3><blockquote>The chapel is a shambles, with overturned and broken pews littering the dusty floor. Dozens of candles mounted in candlesticks and candelabras light every dusty corner in a fervent attempt to rid the chapel of shadows. At the far end of the church sits a claw-scarred altar, behind which kneels a priest in soiled vestments. Next to him hangs a long, thick rope that stretches up into the bell tower.</blockquote><br>If the characters have not already entered the undercroft, add:<br><br><blockquote>From beneath the chapel floor, you hear a young man’s voice cry out, “Father! I’m starving!”</blockquote><br><strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZjIxMDYwN2RhZjcx ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Donavich</a></strong> (LG male human) has been praying throughout the night. His voice is hoarse and weak. He is, in a word, insane. A little more than a year ago, his twenty-year-old son <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YTk4Y2EzYWNiODM0 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Doru</a> and several other villagers stormed Castle Ravenloft in revolt, having been lured there by a wizard in black robes who came to Barovia from a faraway land (see <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YTBjMzk0Yzk5NzMy ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>The Mad Mage</a> entry for more information on the wizard). By all accounts, the wizard died by Strahd’s hand, and so too did Doru, who returned to his father as a vampire spawn. Donavich was able to trap his son in the church’s undercroft, where he remains to this day.<br><br>Doru hasn’t fed since he was imprisoned, and he cries out to his father at all hours. Meanwhile, Donavich prays day and night, hoping that the gods will tell him how to save Doru without destroying him. If the characters seem intent on slaying Doru, Donavich does his best to stop them. If Doru dies, Donavich falls to the floor and weeps inconsolably, overcome with despair.<br><br>In addition to the lore known to all Barovians (see “<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NDM2ZTc2NDNmODQw ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Barovian Lore</a>” in chapter 2), Donavich knows the following useful information:<br><br><ul><li>Ireena Kolyana isn’t the natural daughter of Kolyan Indirovich. Although Ireena never knew, Kolyan found her at the edge of the Svalich Woods near the Pillarstone of Ravenloft. She was but a girl then and seemed to have no memory of her past. Kolyan adopted her and loved her dearly.</li><li>Every night at midnight, the spirits of dead adventurers rise up out of the church graveyard, forming a silent procession as they walk the road toward Castle Ravenloft. (See “March of the Dead” in the “<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YmE3MmE1NmUyMjEx ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Special Events</a>” section.)</li></ul><br><strong><em>Funeral for the Burgomaster.</em></strong> If the characters bring Kolyan Indirovich’s body to the church, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZjIxMDYwN2RhZjcx ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Donavich</a> presses the characters into helping him bury the burgomaster in the cemetery (area E6) at dawn. During the burial, Donavich offers prayers to the Morning­lord in exchange for Kolyan Indirovich’s deliverance from Barovia.<br><br>Once Kolyan is put in the ground, Donavich suggests that Ireena be taken as far from Castle Ravenloft as possible. He proposes that the characters take her to the Abbey of Saint Markovia in <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=OWRkMTE5ZDk1Mjg2 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Krezk</a> (chapter 8) or, failing that, the fortified town of <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YWIzMjIyNzE0OGFk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Vallaki</a> (chapter 5). Donavich is unaware that the abbey, once a bastion of good, has become a den of evil.<br><hr><h3>E5g. Undercroft</h3><blockquote>The church’s undercroft has rough-hewn walls and a floor made of damp clay and earth. Rotting wooden pillars strain under the weight of the wooden ceiling. Candlelight from the chapel above slips though the cracks, allowing you to glimpse a gaunt shape in the far corner.</blockquote><br>The shape is <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YTk4Y2EzYWNiODM0 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Doru</a></strong>, a vampire spawn sent by Strahd to torment Donavich and cast down the church. Doru is starved for blood and brave enough to attack a lone character. If the characters approach as a group, he does his best to avoid them while hissing, “I can smell your blood!” If they cut off his escape, he lunges forth and attacks.<br><br>If the characters restrain Doru and either promise him blood or threaten to destroy him, or if they kill him and then raise him from the dead, he recounts the events that led to his downfall (see area E5f).<br><br><h4><span style=\"color: rgb( 99 , 36 , 35 )\">Fortunes of Ravenloft</span></h4>If your card reading reveals that a treasure is in the undercroft, it’s contained in a moldy, old chest in the southwest corner of the room. The chest is unlocked and not trapped.<br><br><hr><br><h3>E6. Cemetery</h3><blockquote>A fence of wrought iron with a rusty gate encloses a rectangular plot of land behind the dilapidated church. Tightly packed gravestones shrouded by fog bear the names of souls long passed. All seems quiet.</blockquote><br>During daytime, the cemetery is a still and peaceful place. Every night at midnight, however, a ghostly procession takes place (see “March of the Dead” in the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YmE3MmE1NmUyMjEx ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Special Events: Chapter 3</a> handout).<br><hr><br><h3>E7.

Hole in Roof</h3>This 20-foot-diameter hole in the mansion’s roof is directly above <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MmM3OGViZjlhNDM3 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area Q33</a>, the floor of which is 20 feet below. The rubble on the roof surrounding the hole is difficult terrain. The roof is sloped and covered with cracked stone tiles. Climbing the tiled roof requires a successful DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check. A failure by 5 or more causes the climber to slide down to the parapet, landing prone but taking no damage.<br><br><hr><br><h3>Q44. Dragon Gargoyle</h3><blockquote>Perched on the rooftop overlooking the parapet is a silver-plated gargoyle shaped like a dragon wyrmling.</blockquote><br>The silver dragon wyrmling statue is 10 feet above the parapet and has a <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=ZTg5Mzg4MTI1NWEz ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>magic mouth</a></em> spell cast on it. When a character passes in front of it, the spell is activated, and the wyrmling whispers the following short verse in the Common tongue:<br><br>\n<em>When the dragon dreams its dream</em><br>\n<em>Within its rightful tomb,</em><br>\n<em>The light of Argynvost will beam</em><br>\n<em>And rid this land of gloom.<br><br></em>When the characters hear this verse, reveal <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=N2I4N2U0ZjM3ZjZh ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Handout: Dragon Gargoyle Verse</a>.<br><br><hr><br><h3>Q45. Ancient Ballista</h3><blockquote>An ancient ballista, rotted by time and weather, stands behind the battlements on this tower rooftop.</blockquote><br>The ballista falls apart if disturbed.<br><br><hr><br><h3>Q46. Destroyed Ballista</h3><blockquote>Strewn atop the roof toward the front of the mansion is the wreckage of a ballista. Flanking the wreckage are two stone turrets with conical rooftops and narrow doors.</blockquote><br>The turrets are described in area Q47.<br><br><hr><br><h3>Q47. Roof Turrets</h3><blockquote>Cobwebs hang from the rafters of this turret, which is empty except for a wooden bench and an iron stove. Arrow slits look down upon the foggy grounds in front of the mansion.</blockquote><br>The knights who once guarded the rooftop used these turrets for warmth and shelter on rainy days and cold nights.<br><br><hr><br><h3>Q48. Roof's Edge</h3><blockquote>Beyond a ragged edge of stone is a sixty-foot plunge to the rubble-strewn ground below. A few rafters stick out from beneath the stone.</blockquote><br>The edge of the roof is sturdy enough to walk on, and not in danger of further collapse. It’s 20 feet down to <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MmM3OGViZjlhNDM3 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area Q32</a>, 40 feet down to <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZmJhY2Q0N2E0MTgz ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area Q19</a>, and 60 feet down to <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=OGZkMWVkZjExOTc5 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area Q4</a>.<br><br><hr><br><h3>Q49. Beacon Tower Door</h3><blockquote>The parapet narrows to a width of ten feet, ending before a sturdy wooden door set into the wall of the eastern tower.</blockquote><br>This door is barred from the inside. The <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZjY5OTY2MDRhZWUz ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>phantom warriors with spectral longbows</a></strong> in the tower’s turrets (area Q52) make ranged attacks against characters who try to force their way into the tower. These spectral defenders have three-quarters <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ODA4NmEzMTcyNDRh ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>cover</a> behind the arrow slits.<br><br><hr><br><h3>Q50. Beacon, Lower Landing</h3><blockquote>A rickety wooden landing and a staircase cling to the walls of this tower. The stairs lead up to another landing twenty feet above, and the floor of the chapel lies sixty feet below.</blockquote><br>The landing and the stairs creak and shudder underfoot, but they are safe.<br><br><hr><br><h3>Q51. Beacon, Upper Landing</h3><blockquote>Creaky stairs climb to a wooden landing with three windows that look out over the roof of the mansion. Flanking the windows are two narrow wooden doors.</blockquote><br>The landing creaks and groans underfoot, much like in area Q50, but here things aren’t so safe. The 10-foot-long section marked T on the map is particularly weak, collapsing under 50 or more pounds of weight. A creature on this section of the landing when it collapses must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall 20 feet to the landing below (area Q50). The collapse of this section creates a 10-foot gap in the landing.<br><br>\nThe doors lead to the rooftops of the turrets (area Q52).<br><br><hr><br><h3>Q52. Beacon Turrets</h3><blockquote>A stone battlement encloses the roof of this turret. A spiral staircase descends to the level below.</blockquote><br>These turret rooftops are 80 feet above ground level. The spiral stairs descend 20 feet to archers’ posts—small rooms lined with arrow slits. Standing guard in each of these rooms is a <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZjY5OTY2MDRhZWUz ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>phantom warrior with spectral longbow</a></strong> that shoots arrows of force energy.<br><br><hr><br><h3>Q53. Beacon of Argynvostholt</h3><blockquote>Wooden stairs climb to the tower’s peak, which has a stone floor and a thirty-foot-high pitched roof. Ravens roost on crisscrossing rafters, coming and going through small holes in the roof. Ten-foot-high, five-foot-wide arched windows are evenly spaced around the walls. Each window consists of a lead latticework fitted with small panes of transparent glass.</blockquote><br>The <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NzRhZTYwNWFkYTIy ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>ravens</a></strong> that roost here are harmless, but they watch the characters with great interest. If the characters look out the windows, you can use the following text to describe what they see in the distance.<br><br><br><blockquote>To the north and east lies a mist-shrouded valley with dark woods, a small town, and a lonely windmill on a precipice. To the south, a river flows through a foggy marsh. To the west, between rocky hills, you glimpse an abbey perched on a snowy mountainside beyond a long stretch of fog-smothered pines<br></blockquote><p><span style=\"background-color: rgb( 255 , 255 , 255 )\"><br></span></p><span style=\"background-color: rgb( 255 , 255 , 255 )\">The small town is Vallaki (chapter 5). The windmill is Old Bonegrinder (chapter 6). The abbey is the Abbey of Saint Markovia in Krezk (chapter 8).<br></span><br><h4>Lighting the Beacon</h4>When the skull of Argynvost is placed in the dragon’s mausoleum (area Q16), the dragon’s spirit transforms into a brilliant light that fills this room and flashes across the valley like the beacon of a lighthouse. Even if the tower is cast down, the light of Argynvost remains where it is, flashing in the sky. Although the mountains prevent the beacon’s light from reaching Castle Ravenloft directly, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTZiYzA5N2ViNTZi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Strahd</a> can see the light’s glow in the sky to the west.<br><br>\nThe beacon can be seen in <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YWIzMjIyNzE0OGFk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Vallaki</a> (chapter 5), <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=OWRkMTE5ZDk1Mjg2 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Krezk</a> (chapter 8), and <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NTkwZjliZmMwNGQ2 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Berez</a> (chapter 10), as well as from <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MDYyMDU5ZmM4Y2I1 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Old Bonegrinder</a> (chapter 6), <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YzI4NTRlMTIxMTFk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Van Richten’s Tower</a> (chapter 11), and the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YTVjNmQ2ZmVkZGY5 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>werewolf den</a> (chapter 15).<br><br>\nThe beacon’s light can be “felt” even by creatures that are blind. The light allows good-aligned creatures to experience glimmers of hope and joy, while evil creatures find the light disconcerting.<br><br><em><strong>Beacon of Protection. </strong></em>While the beacon shines, characters and other creatures that oppose <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTZiYzA5N2ViNTZi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Strahd</a> gain a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws for as long as they remain in Barovia.<br><br>\n<strong><em>Revenants at Rest. </em></strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YjkzZjg3MTA0Zjlh ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Vladimir Horngaard</a> and the other <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ODIxNTQ5NTg2YmNk ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>revenants</a> that haunt Barovia see the light as a reminder of all that was once good and noble about the knightly order to which they once belonged. They let go of their hatred and their corporeal bodies, leaving corpses behind as their spirits find rest at long last. Henceforth, any random encounter with a revenant should be treated as no encounter.<br><br><h4><span style=\"color: rgb( 99 , 36 , 35 )\">Fortunes of Ravenloft</span></h4>If your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it’s resting on the west windowsill.<br></section>","img":"modules/cor-cos/journal/007_-_Chapter_7_3A_Argynvostholt/006_-_Argynvostholt_Rooftop_and_Beacon/avatar.webp"}

The disturbance attracts the attention of a pack of werewolves, which arrives after 1 hour.<br><br>The werewolves haunt the Svalich Woods west of Van Richten’s Tower. They come running in wolf form, hoping to trap prey on the island by cutting off access to the causeway.<br><br>Leading the hunt is <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YTg2NDBjZjMwMzQ1 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i><strong>Kiril Stoyanovich</strong></a>, a werewolf with 90 hit points.

While in wolf form, the werewolves are indistinguishable from ordinary wolves.

The werewolves know that the tower has magical defenses, so they are cautious. Kiril tries to lure the characters outside for a final showdown, but pulls his pack into the woods if the characters start lobbing spells or making ranged attacks from the tower.<br><br><h4>Development</h4>A captured werewolf can be forced to divulge the whereabouts of the children kidnapped by the pack. They are being held in a cave to the west (see chapter 15, “<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YTVjNmQ2ZmVkZGY5 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Werewolf Den</a>”).<br><hr><br><h3>Ezmerelda’s Retreat</h3><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTFlNDZhMzkxNDAy ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i><strong>Ezmerelda d’Avenir</strong></a> returns to Van Richten’s Tower after confronting Strahd in Castle Ravenloft and barely escaping with her life. She arrives on the back of a <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=M2EyMGQ5MWU5MjI4 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>riding horse</a></strong> stolen from the Vistani camp outside Vallaki (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ODllODk5YTg3YTEx ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>chapter 5, area N9</a>).<br><br>Ezmerelda hopes that the arsenal of weapons in her wagon will be enough to protect her from the vampire’s wrath. If the characters blew up the wagon, she is understandably annoyed and retreats to the tower. (She knows the trick to bypassing the trap on the tower door.) If the tower has also been destroyed, she doesn’t stick around unless the characters are clearly her best hope of survival.<br><br>Ezmerelda’s altercation with Strahd has left her with only 30 hit points. She graciously accepts any healing the characters have to offer.<br><br><h4>Development</h4>From this moment on, Strahd gains a new goal: kill <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTFlNDZhMzkxNDAy ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Ezmerelda d’Avenir</a>. Knowing that his Vistani spies might be conflicted at the thought of slaying one of their own, Strahd relies on the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YTdmMjgwYzBiMTA2 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>druids</a> and the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=N2FhNWZiMTc5Yzdj ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>werewolves</a> of the Svalich Woods, as well as human spies and vampire spawn hidden in Barovia’s settlements, to help him find and kill Ezmerelda. If Strahd learns that she and the characters are working together, he invites the characters to Ravenloft, expecting that Ezmerelda will accompany them. The characters receive their invitation in the form of a letter delivered by one of Strahd’s spies.

You can use one or both of the following special events while the characters explore the temple.<br><br><h3>Rahadin’s Prayer</h3>Strahd’s loyal chamberlain, <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=M2NlY2IzOWI5Nzhi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Rahadin</a></strong>, believes that his master forged a pact with the nameless god of secrets to whom the Amber Temple is dedicated. The dusk elf comes to the temple on occasion to petition the dark god into releasing his master from his torment.<br><br>Rahadin rides a <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=MjRiOGM4M2E5Njg4 ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>phantom steed</a></em> along <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MTE0NDVmZTc2Nzlk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Tsolenka Pass</a> to the Amber Temple and kneels before the great statue in <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZmRiYTJmZWRkNmVm ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area X5</a>. (The <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ODhhYmViZWU0YmFi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>arcanaloth</a> that guards the temple knows Rahadin and doesn’t harm him. The arcanaloth and the flameskulls don’t attack other visitors until Rahadin is killed or leaves.) Rahadin then pulls out a live toad, swallows it whole as a sacrifice, and offers a gesture of supplication to the secret god.<br><br><h4>Development</h4>Rahadin knows that Strahd will deal with the characters when he sees fit. If the characters confront the dusk elf, he defends himself but won’t cause them any permanent harm. Strahd’s chamberlain would sooner die than allow himself to be captured. Rahadin doesn’t divulge his reason for visiting the temple, or even who is he or what role he serves. Left to his own devices, he rides back to Castle Ravenloft.<br><hr><br><h3>Kasimir’s Dark Gift</h3>If <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OGY5ODNiNzk2MzI4 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Kasimir Velikov</a></strong> (see chapter 5, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YWIzMjIyNzE0OGFk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area N9a</a>) finds his way to <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NjAxOTQ4MWE0MmMy ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area X42</a> and accepts the dark gift of Zhudun, he then asks the characters to accompany him to the catacombs of Castle Ravenloft so that he can restore the life of his centuries-dead sister, Patrina Velikovna (see chapter 4, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YzI0YTFjYTVjY2Jh ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K84</a>, crypt 21).<br><br><h4>Development</h4>If Kasimir succeeds in his quest, the newly resurrected <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NjcyNWRkZmY0YzFi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i><strong>Patrina Velikovna</strong></a> (NE female dusk elf) feigns repentance until she regains her strength and her spells, whereupon she travels to Castle Ravenloft and attempts to return to <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTZiYzA5N2ViNTZi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Strahd</a>, seeking to become his vampire bride at last. The mutilation of her brother at the hands of <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=M2NlY2IzOWI5Nzhi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Rahadin</a>, Strahd’s chamberlain, doesn’t sit well with her. She hopes to avenge her brother and distract the characters by setting them on a path to killing Rahadin, who has long opposed her marriage to Strahd.<br><br>Strahd has lost interest in Patrina as a consort. Given the chance, he turns her into a vampire spawn and puts her back in her crypt—a fate she would do everything in her power to prevent. Her attraction to Strahd is outmatched by a desire to increase her own power. She is no one’s plaything.<br></section>","img":""}

Audience Hall</h3><blockquote>Dim light from the courtyard falls into this great hall through the broken glass and iron latticework of a large window in the west wall. This immense room is a place of chilly, brooding darkness. Empty iron sconces dot the walls. Hundreds of dust-laden cobwebs drape the hall, hiding the ceiling from view. Directly across from the window stand a set of double doors in the east wall. Farther south, a single door also leads from the east wall. Staircases at both ends of the north wall lead down.<br><br>At the far southern end of the hall, a large wooden throne stands atop a marble dais. The high-backed throne faces south, away from most of the room.</blockquote><br>A secret door in the south wall leads to <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZmU0Yjk2NzNiY2U4 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K13</a>. It is hidden by dust and cobwebs, and requires a successful DC 16 Wisdom (Perception) check to find.<br><br>Both staircases in the north wall lead down to <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZmU0Yjk2NzNiY2U4 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K19</a>. The eastern double doors can be pulled open to reveal area K26 beyond. The single door in the east wall opens into area K30.<br><br><h4><span style=\"color: rgb( 99 , 36 , 35 )\">Fortunes of Ravenloft</span></h4>If your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it lies on the marble dais, just behind the throne.<br><br>If your card reading indicates an encounter with <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTZiYzA5N2ViNTZi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Strahd</a> in this area, he is sitting on the wooden throne.<br><br><hr><br><h3>K26. Guards’ Post</h3>If the characters enter this hall through either set of double doors, read:<br><br><blockquote>The doors open to reveal another set of double doors ten feet ahead. Between these doors, a ten-foot-wide corridor stretches north to south. At each end of the hall, floating in the darkness, is a human skeleton clad in the rusted armor and tattered livery of a castle guard.</blockquote><br>The “floating” skeletons hang from pegs on the north and south walls. The skeletons, which were assembled by <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NGE3OWU5NGU0Zjli ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Cyrus Belview</a> (see <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YWUwMjk4ZDM0NDI1 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K62</a>), are held together with wire and are harmless. Behind the skeleton on the north wall is a secret door that can be pushed open into area K33.<br><br>If the characters enter this hall by way of the secret door that adjoins area K33, they see the skeleton hanging on the inside of the secret door as soon as they pull it open, and, with a light source or darkvision, can see the skeleton at the south end of the hall as well.<br><br><hr><br><h3>K27. King’s Hall</h3><blockquote>This twenty-foot-high hall has a dark, vaulted ceiling draped with cobwebs. A low moan seems to travel the length of the corridor as it rises and falls, intoning sadness and despair.</blockquote><br>The moaning is only the wind.<br><br>Characters who examine the ceiling can, with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check, spot pulleys and a rope that run the full length of the corridor along the ceiling, well hidden by the cobwebs. These items are explained in “Flight of the Vampire” below.<br><br>Halfway down the hall on the south side is a narrow secret door that can be pulled open to reveal area K31.<br><br><h4>Flight of the Vampire</h4>Hidden in a compartment above the western set of double doors is a dressed wooden mannequin that looks exactly like Strahd. It wears a black cloak, its fangs are bared, and its arms and clawed fingers are outstretched in a threatening manner. The mannequin is attached to a rope that runs through pulleys fastened along the length of the hallway ceiling.<br><br>When one or more characters reach the midpoint of the hall from either direction, read:<br><br><blockquote>You hear a scraping sound of stone against stone, followed by the squeaking of a bat. In the direction of the noise, you see the fanged visage, outstretched claws, and flapping black cape of a vampire bearing down on you from above! A deep, throaty chuckle fills the hall.</blockquote><br>The scraping noise is the sound of the hidden compartment opening, and the squeaking is the sound of the pulleys supporting the weight of the mannequin as it glides through the air. The chuckling is a harmless magical effect similar to that created by a <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=YjQzY2NjYjc3Mjk1 ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>prestidigitation</a></em> cantrip.<br><br>Have the players roll initiative, and run this as a combat encounter with the “vampire” acting on initiative count 5. On its turn, the mannequin flies over the characters, 10 feet above the floor, and doesn’t stop until it reaches the east end of the hall. On its next turn, it reverses direction and flies back to its compartment. The trap resets after 1 minute.<br><br>A character who attacks the mannequin from the floor needs a range of at least 10 feet. The mannequin has AC 15 and 10 hit points, and it is immune to poison and psychic damage. If the mannequin is reduced to 0 hit points while in the air, it falls to the floor.<br><br><hr><br><h3>K28. King’s Balcony</h3><blockquote>A sculpted stone railing encloses this long balcony, which overlooks Ravenloft’s chapel. Two ornate thrones stand side by side in the center of the balcony, covered with dust and strung with cobwebs. The thrones face away from the double doors that give access to the balcony.</blockquote><br>Two <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ODM2ODk3OGYwN2Nl ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Strahd zombies</a></strong> are slouched on the thrones. They remain motionless until one of them is disturbed or another creature comes within a zombie’s reach, whereupon they attack.<br><br>The balcony is 50 feet above the floor of the chapel (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZmU0Yjk2NzNiY2U4 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K15</a>). A staircase north of the double doors leads down to area K29.<br><br><hr><br><h3>K29. Creaky Landing</h3><blockquote>This staircase is made of old wood that strains underfoot, creaking and groaning.</blockquote><br>The staircase climbs from <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZmU0Yjk2NzNiY2U4 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K16</a> to area K28. It seems unstable but is sturdy. The creatures in area K28 can’t be surprised by anyone climbing the creaky steps.<br><br><hr><br><h3>K30. King’s Accountant</h3><blockquote>Dusty scrolls and tomes line the walls of this room. More scrolls and books lie scattered on the floor, around four heavy wooden chests fitted with study iron locks. The only unobstructed floor space is directly in front of the doors on the east and west walls.<br><br>In the center of this clutter stands a great black desk. A figure crouches atop a tall stool, scratching on a seemingly endless scroll of paper with a dry quill pen. Nearby a tasseled rope hangs from a hole in the ceiling.</blockquote><br>The figure is <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OGMwMzRmMGM4YzUx ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Lief Lipsiege</a></strong>, an accountant. He is chained to the heavy wooden desk and has no interest in the characters or their concerns. Under no circumstances does he voluntarily leave the room. Lief pulls the rope the instant he feels threatened.<br><br>Pulling the rope requires an action. When the rope is pulled, a tremendously loud gong sounds. One or more creatures arrive 1d6 rounds later, attacking any characters still in the room. Determine the creatures randomly by rolling a d4:<br><br><table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n<strong>d4</strong>\n</td><td valign=\"top\">\n<strong>Creature</strong>\n</td></tr><tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n1\n</td><td valign=\"top\">\n1d6 <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZWZkNWI3YTE5NmE4 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>shadows</a></strong>\n</td></tr><tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n2\n</td><td valign=\"top\">\n1d4 <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YWM4NmJjYmJiMGE1 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>vampire spawn</a></strong>\n</td></tr><tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n3\n</td><td valign=\"top\">\n1d4 <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YzUzY2VhZmYxZDFh ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>wights</a></strong>\n</td></tr><tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n4\n</td><td valign=\"top\">\n1 <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=N2FlYWQxMzI0OTRj ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>wraith</a></strong> and 1d4 + 1 <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OTJmMjVhNzNlOWY0 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>specters</a></strong> </td></tr></tbody></table><br>Lief was pressed into service by Strahd many years ago. He keeps all the books for Strahd, recording the vampire’s riches and conquests. Lief has been here longer than he can remember. He is grumpy because Strahd doesn’t allow him to know about all his treasures. Even so, Lief has found out where one of Strahd’s secret treasures lies. If he is treated with kindness, Lief will divulge the hiding place of the <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YmY5ZjM2YTY3ZDgz ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Holy Symbol of Ravenkind</a></em>, as indicated by your card reading. Lief can draw a crude map showing a route to that location. His map is geographically accurate, but he admits that it doesn’t acknowledge or avoid any dangers that might lie along the way. Lief doesn’t necessarily know the most direct path to the symbol’s location.<br><br>Lief knows that there’s a key that unlocks all four chests, but he can’t remember where he hid it. See “Treasure” below for more information.<br><br>The western door leads to area K25. The eastern door provides access to a staircase (area K21) that leads down to <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZmU0Yjk2NzNiY2U4 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K9</a> and up to a landing outside <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZTM3NDAwZGFhNGE5 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K35</a>, continuing upward from there to <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=M2JjYzQ4NTk1NjM1 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K47</a>.<br><br><h4>Treasure</h4>The room contains hundreds of worthless books and scrolls describing accounting procedures. The first character who spends at least 10 minutes searching the room and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check finds a book with a bloodstained leather cover. The pages of this book have been hollowed out, creating a hole in which Lief has hidden the iron key that unlocks the four wooden chests in this room.<br><br>Two of the locked chests contain 10,000 cp each. A third chest contains 1,000 gp. The fourth chest holds 500 pp, hidden under which is a <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ODQ3YmRhYjVkYWEz ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>manual of bodily health</a></em>.<br><br><hr><br><h3>K31. Trapworks</h3><blockquote>The aromas of grease and well-oiled wood hit your nostrils as you pull open the door. This ten-by-twenty-foot room is filled with intricate machinery, except for small spaces between the stone gears and the iron chains and pulleys. On the other side of the machinery, to the south, is a rectangular shaft that rises up from the darkness and continues past this room. Attached to the west wall is a steel plate that has an iron lever protruding downward.</blockquote><br>See the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MzBiMWZhMTQ2NmRl ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Elevator Trap</a> handout. The shaft (area K31a) descends 90 feet from here to <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YWUwMjk4ZDM0NDI1 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K61</a>, and ascends 40 feet to <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=Yjc3NTVkZDRiZmEz ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K31b</a>. Another 40 feet above that is a stone trapdoor in the ceiling that opens into <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=M2JjYzQ4NTk1NjM1 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K47</a>.<br><br>Operating the machinery in this room raises a stone elevator compartment from the bottom of the shaft, lifting it past this room to the top of the shaft. See <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YWUwMjk4ZDM0NDI1 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K61</a> for more information on the elevator trap.<br><br>A character can spend 1 minute disabling the machinery in this room. The elevator trap won’t function until the machinery is repaired.<br><br>The iron lever set into the western wall is normally in the “down” position. Moving it to the “up” position activates the trap and raises the elevator. Sliding it back down lowers the elevator and resets the trap.<br><br>When the elevator trap in <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YWUwMjk4ZDM0NDI1 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K61</a> is activated, all the chains, pulleys, and gears in this room move at once. It takes 10 seconds (1 round) for the elevator to reach the top of the shaft, and the machinery doesn’t stop until the elevator completes its journey.<br><br>A secret door in the north wall is easy to spot from this side (no ability check required) and opens into <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=Yjc3NTVkZDRiZmEz ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K27</a>.<br><br><hr><br><h3>K31a. Elevator Shaft</h3><blockquote>Cold air fills this rectangular shaft, the walls of which are coated with mildew and worn smooth. Taut iron chains extend up and down the shaft. The links of the chains are thick and covered with grease.</blockquote><br>The shaft is 170 feet tall. It starts at <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YWUwMjk4ZDM0NDI1 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K61</a>, climbs 90 feet to area K31, another 40 feet to <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=Yjc3NTVkZDRiZmEz ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K31b</a>, and another 40 feet to <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=M2JjYzQ4NTk1NjM1 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K47</a>. When the elevator trap is activated (see <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YWUwMjk4ZDM0NDI1 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K61</a> for details), a stone elevator compartment measuring 10 feet on a side rises up the western half of the shaft. At the same time, a solid block of stone, also 10 feet on a side, descends in the eastern half of the shaft, acting as a counterweight. Both stone blocks have thick iron chains bolted to them, by which they are hoisted and lowered them as needed.<br><br>Scaling the shaft is impossible without the aid of magic or the use of a climber’s kit, because the walls are smooth and slick with mildew, and the greasy iron chains are too thick and slippery to grasp.<br><br>Set into the roof of the shaft is a 5-foot-square stone trapdoor that can be pushed open to reveal <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=M2JjYzQ4NTk1NjM1 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K47</a>.<br><br><hr><br><h3>K31b. Shaft Access</h3><blockquote>This ten-foot-square room overlooks a vertical shaft to the south that plunges into darkness and continues upward.</blockquote><br>This vantage point is 130 feet from the bottom of the shaft (area K31a). Forty feet down is area K31, and 40 feet up is a stone trapdoor in the ceiling that opens into <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=M2JjYzQ4NTk1NjM1 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K47</a>.<br><br>A door in the north wall is easy to spot from this side (no ability check required) and opens into <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZTM3NDAwZGFhNGE5 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K39</a>.<br><br><hr><br><h3>K32. Maid in Hell</h3><blockquote>Oil lamps illuminate this long, rectangular chamber with oak-paneled walls. Stained, yellowed lace hangs neatly from eight canopied beds. The figure of a woman moves lithely about the room, dusting furniture and humming quietly. Around her pale, slender neck is a gold necklace with a ruby pendant.</blockquote><br>The maid, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTkwMTYyYjM5OTdk ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Helga Ruvak</a>, is a <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YWM4NmJjYmJiMGE1 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>vampire spawn</a></strong> who claims to be the daughter of the village bootmaker, kidnapped and forced into service by Strahd. She pleads, on her hands and knees if necessary, to be saved from this awful place.<br><br>Helga will join the party if the characters ask her along. She intends to attack the characters but does so only if she senses an opportunity that doesn’t involve having to fight the entire party. She also attacks if commanded to do so by Strahd.<br><br>Helga plays the part of the innocent damsel in distress to the last, revealing her ferocity only when she attacks. She is, in fact, the bootmaker’s daughter she claims to be, but she chose a life of evil with Strahd.<br><br><h4>Treasure</h4>Helga’s gold necklace with its ruby pendant is a gift from Strahd. The necklace is almost five centuries old and is worth 750 gp.<br><br><hr><br><h3>K33. King’s Apartment Stair</h3>This dark hall is concealed behind two secret doors.<br><br><blockquote>This arched corridor has been swept clean. Oak paneling decorates the walls to a height of four feet. Mounted on the east wall above the wood paneling are three unlit oil lamps spaced ten feet apart. A plain wooden door is set into the west wall, and light seeps through its cracks. A staircase at the north end of the west wall ascends into darkness.</blockquote><br>The staircase climbs 40 feet to <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZTM3NDAwZGFhNGE5 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K45</a>. The door in the west wall opens into area K32.<br><br><hr><br><h3>K34. Servants’ Upper Floor</h3><blockquote>Dirt-caked windows allow little light to enter this upstairs room. Broken bed frames and torn bits of mattress litter the floors. A tall, dusty wardrobe roughly shaped like a coffin, its black doors painted with fey creatures, stands between two cracked, full-length mirrors hanging on the south wall. A staircase descends along the north wall.</blockquote><br>If someone opens the wardrobe, read:<br><br><blockquote>A plain white dress yellowed with age flies out of the wardrobe and begins to dance in the middle of the room.

From this light emerges a ghostly procession.

Every night, the ghostly adventurers attempt to complete their quest, and each night they fail. They have no interest in the living and can’t be hit, damaged, or turned.

She goes from house to house, knocking on doors. Most of the time, no one answers. When someone does, Morgantha tries to peddle her wares, offering customers an escape from the misery and despair of everyday Barovian life. If the characters shadow her for a while, she collects payment from one household in the form of a seven-year-old boy named Lucian Jarov (LG male human noncombatant). Lucian’s parents plead with Morgantha not to take their boy, but she snatches the crying child from their grasp, stuffs him in a sack, straps him down to her peddler’s cart, and casually makes her way back to Old Bonegrinder.<br><br>Morgantha recognizes that the characters are strangers and does her best to avoid them. If the characters demand the release of the child, she grudgingly complies, knowing that she can always come back for the boy later.

Dungeon Hall</h3>\n<p>The following boxed text assumes that the characters arrive by way of the staircase to the east (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"ZmU0Yjk2NzNiY2U4\">area K21</a>). Adjust as needed if the characters enter this hall from another direction.<br /><br /></p>\n<blockquote>The stairs descend into black, still water that fills an arched hallway before you. The water&rsquo;s surface is like dark, mirrored glass, disturbed only occasionally by the &ldquo;thwick&rdquo; of a drop falling from the ceiling. Twenty feet ahead, arched doorways lead downward from each side of the hallway. In each arched doorway, an iron door stands closed and partially submerged. You hear a weak cry for help from beyond the south door.</blockquote>\n<p><br />The water is 3 feet deep in the hallway and opaque. The steps on both sides of the hallway descend another 2 feet before ending at the iron doors to the north and south.<br /><br />The floor beneath the water isn&rsquo;t as solid as one might expect. There is a safe path around several weight-sensitive trapdoors (see the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"YzU0NWExNGY4ZmNm\">Traps in Area K73</a> diagram), but the water makes it impossible to see where the trapdoors are. For every 10 pounds of weight on a trapdoor, there is a 5 percent chance that the trapdoor will open. The 10-foot-deep pit under each trapdoor contains a magic teleport trap that activates as soon as the trapdoor opens. Any Medium or smaller creature on a trapdoor when it opens plunges into the pit and is teleported to a cell in either area K74 or K75, as the diagram indicates.<br /><br />When a character sets off a trap, other characters in the hall see an explosion of air and water fly up around the triggering character (air that was trapped in the pit is released suddenly when the trapdoor opens). The triggering character suddenly falls from sight. An instant later, the trapdoor closes, leaving only a slowly dissipating swirl in the water. It doesn&rsquo;t open again until 24 hours have passed, at which point its teleport trap is recharged.<br /><br />Characters who fall victim to the teleport traps are transported to dungeon cells closed with iron bars and under 5 feet of brackish water (areas K74 and K75).<br /><br /></p>\n<hr />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>K74. North Dungeon</h3>\n<p>The rusty iron door connecting this hall to area K73 is submerged in 5 feet of water and requires a successful DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check to open.<br /><br /></p>\n<blockquote>A mold-covered ceiling hangs three feet above the still, black water that fills this dungeon corridor. The water is five feet deep. Ten-foot-square cells, their entrances blocked by iron bars, line both sides of the hall. One of the cells is dimly lit.</blockquote>\n<p><br />The corridor is 40 feet long. Branching off it are eight cells, four along each wall. Light spills out of cell K74h.<br /><br />A hinged door made up of 1-inch-thick rusted iron bars spaced 4 inches apart, with horizontal crossbars spaced 6 inches apart, closes off each cell. Each door is fitted with an iron lock. A character using thieves&rsquo; tools can try to pick a lock, which requires 1 minute and a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. The check is made with disadvantage if the character is trying to pick the lock from inside the cell. If the check fails, the character can try again.<br /><br />A character can force open a barred door by using an action and succeeding on a DC 25 Strength check.<br /><br /><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"ZTZiYzA5N2ViNTZi\">Strahd</a> visits the dungeon occasionally to see whether any characters have become trapped here. He can enter a cell by assuming mist form.<br /><br /></p>\n<h4>K74a. Forgotten Treasure</h4>\n<p>This cell is linked to a teleport trap in area K73. Characters who enter the cell can feel coins shifting beneath their feet.<br /><br /><strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> Scattered across the floor of this cell are 3,000 ep. The coins have the profiled visage of Strahd von Zarovich stamped on them. A character can scoop up one hundred coins every minute.<br /><br /></p>\n<h4>K74b. Forgotten Treasure</h4>\n<blockquote>The rusted door to this cell hangs open slightly.</blockquote>\n<p><br />Characters who enter the cell can feel coins shifting beneath their feet.<br /><br /><strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> Scattered across the floor of this cell are 300 pp. The coins have the profiled visage of Strahd von Zarovich stamped on them. A character can scoop up one hundred coins every minute.<br /><br /></p>\n<h4>K74c. Rotting Corpse</h4>\n<blockquote>Clinging to the bars of this otherwise empty cell is the rotting corpse of a male half-elf dressed in leather armor.</blockquote>\n<p><br />This cell is linked to a teleport trap in area K73.<br /><br /><strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> A search of the corpse yields a sheathed longsword and two belt pouches, one containing five gemstones (50 gp each) and the other containing a <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"ZDMwNDM0MTc1N2Zi\">potion of heroism</a></em>.<br /><br /></p>\n<h4>K74d. Empty Cell</h4>\n<p>This cell contains nothing of interest.<br /><br /></p>\n<h4>K74e. End of the Ride</h4>\n<p>This cell is linked to a teleport trap in area K73.<br /><br /><strong><em>Secret Door.</em></strong> A secret door is 5 feet up from the floor on the north wall of this cell. The secret door can&rsquo;t be opened from this side without the use of a <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"NzgzNWMwNDZlYzNh\">knock</a></em> spell or similar magic. Behind the secret door is a chute of polished black marble that slants upward (area K82).<br /><br /></p>\n<h4>K74f. Empty Cell</h4>\n<p>This cell contains nothing of interest.<br /><br /></p>\n<h4>K74g. Gray Ooze</h4>\n<p>Clinging to the floor of this cell is a <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"ZmFkNzBkNzkxYWQw\">gray ooze</a></strong> that attacks anything that enters. While underwater, the ooze is effectively invisible.<br /><br /></p>\n<h4>K74h. Lost Sword</h4>\n<blockquote>A glowing blade can be seen beneath the water near the back of the cell.</blockquote>\n<p><br />This cell is linked to a teleport trap in area K73.<br /><br /><strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> The source of the underwater glow is a <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"MGQ5MmVlZDYyZjE2\">crusading shortsword</a></em>.<br /><br /></p>\n<hr />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>K75. South Dungeon</h3>\n<p>The rusty iron door connecting this hall to area K73 is submerged in 5 feet of water and requires a successful DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check to open.<br /><br /></p>\n<blockquote>A mold-covered ceiling hangs three feet above the still, black water that fills this dungeon corridor. The water is five feet deep. Ten-foot-square cells, their entrances blocked by iron bars, line both sides of the hall. From one of the cells, you hear a gruff voice ask, &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo;</blockquote>\n<p><br />The corridor is 40 feet long. Branching off it are eight cells, four along each wall. The voice comes from one of the southernmost cells (area K75a).<br /><br /></p>\n<h4>K75a. Prisoner</h4>\n<blockquote>A strong young man clutches the bars of his cell while struggling to keep his teeth from chattering. His clothes are shredded, and he is soaked from head to toe.</blockquote>\n<p><br />The man is <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"ZjY1N2ZhZTg1OTUz\">Emil Toranescu</a></strong>, a werewolf. He claims to be a resident of Vallaki who was chased by dire wolves to the castle. He begs the characters to rescue him, offering to help them in exchange.<br /><br />In truth, Strahd locked Emil here as punishment for causing a schism in his <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"YTVjNmQ2ZmVkZGY5\">werewolf pack</a>. Anxious to prove his worth to Strahd, Emil rewards the characters for freeing him by attacking them when a good opportunity arises. Emil doesn&rsquo;t turn against the characters if they claim to be allies of his wife, Zuleika. In that case, he tries to leave the castle and reunite with her, staying with the characters only until an opportunity to leave presents itself.<br /><br /></p>\n<h4>K75b. Forgotten Treasure</h4>\n<p>Characters who enter the cell can feel coins shifting beneath their feet.<br /><br /><strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> Scattered across the floor of this cell are 2,100 ep. The coins have the profiled visage of Strahd von Zarovich stamped on them. A character can scoop up one hundred coins every minute.<br /><br /></p>\n<h4>K75c. Empty Cell</h4>\n<p>This cell contains nothing of interest.<br /><br /></p>\n<h4>K75d. Dead Dwarf</h4>\n<p>This cell is linked to a teleport trap in area K73. The skeletal remains of a dwarf fighter lie at the bottom of the cell, enclosed in rusted plate armor. The dwarf&rsquo;s nonmagical but usable battleaxe lies nearby.<br /><br /></p>\n<h4>K75e. Empty Cell</h4>\n<p>This cell contains nothing of interest.<br /><br /></p>\n<h4>K75f. Dead Wizard</h4>\n<blockquote>Shackled to the back wall of this cell is an emaciated figure in a blue robe, its spindly arms spread wide and its head tilted forward. Long, gray hair hangs down in front of the dead man&rsquo;s face.</blockquote>\n<p><br />The skeletal figure is all that remains of a human wizard whom Strahd captured and slowly bled to death. Flesh still clings to the wizard&rsquo;s bones, and puncture marks from the vampire&rsquo;s fangs are visible on the wizard&rsquo;s neck.<br /><br /></p>\n<h4>K75g. Hanging Bard</h4>\n<blockquote>Pounded into the roof of this cell is a rusted iron pulley, strung through which is a rope that is tied to one of the crossbeams of the barred door. Dangling upside down from the pulley is a man, flabby and stout of build, in tight-fitting leather armor. His boots are bound with rope just below the pulley, his fleshy hands are tied behind his back, and his head is underwater. He isn&rsquo;t moving.</blockquote>\n<p><br />Strahd had this human bard suspended from the ceiling as a test to see how long he could keep his head above water. The man weakened and drowned. On the floor of the cell, below the hanging corpse, is a smashed lyre.<br /><br /></p>\n<h4>K75h. Empty Cell</h4>\n<p>This cell contains nothing of interest.<br /><br /></p>\n<hr />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>K76. Torture Chamber</h3>\n<blockquote>Dark, low shapes thrust up out of the still, brackish water that fills this fifty-foot-square room, the ceiling of which is festooned with hanging chains that look like thick, black web strands. A balcony set into the north wall overlooks the room and has two large thrones atop it, with a red velvet curtain behind them.</blockquote>\n<p><br />The ceiling is 17 feet above the surface of the water, which is 3 feet deep. The balcony to the north stands 7 feet above the water&rsquo;s surface, 10 feet above the floor.<br /><br />If the characters approach the &ldquo;dark, low shapes&rdquo; in the water, read:<br /><br /></p>\n<blockquote>The dark shapes in the water are racks, iron maidens, stocks, and other instruments of torture. The skeletons of their last victims lie within them, their jaws seemingly frozen open in silent screams.</blockquote>\n<p><br />As soon as one or more characters move more than 10 feet into the room, six <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"ODM2ODk3OGYwN2Nl\">Strahd zombies</a></strong> rise slowly out of the water, their slime-gray arms clawing upward through the water as they attack.<br /><br />Reveal <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"NzdmYmI2Yjk5N2Y2\">Handout: Area K76</a> when the zombies attack.<br /><br /></p>\n<hr />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>K77. Observation Balcony</h3>\n<blockquote>Two large, wooden thrones rest on this balcony. Behind the thrones hangs a red velvet curtain thirty feet long. The ceiling here is ten feet high.</blockquote>\n<p><br />The room continues behind the curtain an additional 10 feet to a wall that has a door in its center.<br /><br /></p>\n<hr />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>K78. Brazier Room</h3>\n<blockquote>This room is thirty feet square, rising to a twenty-foot-tall flat ceiling. A stone brazier burns fiercely in the center of the room, but its tall white flame produces no heat. The rim of the brazier is carved with seven cup-shaped indentations spaced evenly around the circumference. Within each indentation is a spherical stone, twice the diameter of a human eyeball and made of a colored crystal. No two stones are the same color.<br /><br />Overhead, a wood-framed hourglass as tall and wide as a dwarf hangs ten feet above the brazier, suspended from the ceiling by thick iron chains. All the sand is stuck in the upper portion of the hourglass, seemingly unable to run down into the bottom. Written in glowing script on the base of the hourglass is a verse in Common.<br /><br />Two nine-foot-tall iron statues of knights on horseback, poised to charge with swords drawn, stand in deep alcoves facing each other. The brazier sits between them.</blockquote>\n<p><br />The two statues are <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"MWM1MjFiMzY3YmNm\">iron golems</a></strong>. Each horse and rider is considered one creature, and they are inseparable. The golems will not leave the room under any circumstances, and they attack only under specific conditions (see the &ldquo;Development&rdquo; section that follows).<br /><br />The hourglass has AC 12, 20 hit points, immunity to poison and psychic damage, and vulnerability to thunder damage. If the hourglass is reduced to 0 hit points, its glass shatters, causing the sand within it to fall to the floor. The magic writing on the base of the hourglass reads as follows:<br /><br /><em>Cast a stone into the fire:<br />Violet leads to the mountain spire<br />Orange to the castle&rsquo;s peak<br />Red if lore is what you seek<br />Green to where the coffins hide<br />Indigo to the master&rsquo;s bride<br />Blue to ancient magic&rsquo;s womb<br />Yellow to the master&rsquo;s tomb</em><br /><br />You can share this text with the players in <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"ZWI5MThmMDc2NzAz\">Handout: Hourglass Inscription</a>.<br /><br />The brazier&rsquo;s flame is magical and sheds no warmth. A successful casting of <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"MGIwMTBiN2M3ODM2\">dispel magic</a></em> (DC 16) extinguishes the flame for 1 hour. The fire is permanently extinguished if the brazier is destroyed. The brazier has AC 17, 25 hit points, immunity to poison and psychic damage, and resistance to all other damage.<br /><br />The stones set into the brazier&rsquo;s rim are colored red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet, respectively. Tossing one into the brazier causes its flame to change from white to the color of the stone, and the sand begins falling through the hourglass. Any creature that touches the colored flame is teleported to a location within Strahd&rsquo;s domain, as determined by the color:<br /><br /></p>\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\"><strong>Flame Color</strong></td>\n<td valign=\"top\"><strong>Teleports to &hellip;</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">Red</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">Study (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"Yjc3NTVkZDRiZmEz\">area K37</a>)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">Orange</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">North tower peak (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"M2JjYzQ4NTk1NjM1\">area K60</a>)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">Yellow</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">Strahd&rsquo;s tomb (area K86)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">Green</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">Coffin maker&rsquo;s shop (chapter 5, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"MWQ3Zjc2OTNmNmYx\">area N6f</a>)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">Blue</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">Amber Temple (chapter 13, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"NjAxOTQ4MWE0MmMy\">area X42</a>)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">Indigo</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">Abbey of Saint Markovia (chapter 8, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"NWVkN2JjNTEyZDI0\">area S17</a>)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">Violet</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">Tsolenka Pass (chapter 9, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"MTE0NDVmZTc2Nzlk\">area T4</a>)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><br />After 5 rounds, the sand runs out, and the color of the flame returns to white. When the flame does so, the sand instantly reappears in the top part of the hourglass (provided the hourglass is intact), and the stone that was cast into the fire reappears in the brazier&rsquo;s rim.<br /><br /></p>\n<h4>Development</h4>\n<p>If the brazier, the hourglass, or either golem is attacked, the doors of the room magically slam shut and lock (unless they are being held or wedged open), and the golems animate and attack. On the first round, the golems fill the room with their poison breath, which issues from the horses&rsquo; mouths. (Each creature in the room must make two saving throws, one for each breath weapon.) On subsequent rounds, each golem makes one attack with its sword and one slam attack with its hoof. When there are no creatures left to fight in the room, the golems return to their alcoves, and the doors unlock. Forcing open a locked door requires a successful DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check. Each door has AC 15, 25 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.<br /><br /></p>\n<hr />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>K79. Western Stair</h3>\n<blockquote>This staircase of ancient stone is worn smooth. Thick dust covers its steps, and cobwebs choke the passage.</blockquote>\n<p><br />The stairs rise at a 45-degree angle for a distance of 40 feet horizontally, leading to a 10-foot-square landing (see below). A second set of stairs continues upward to the east at a similar angle for a distance of 30 feet horizontally, ending at a secret door that opens into <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"YWUwMjk4ZDM0NDI1\">area K72</a>.<br /><br /></p>\n<h4>Landing</h4>\n<p>Inscribed on the landing, hidden under years of dust, is a <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"ODA4ZGM2NjUxZGU1\">glyph of warding</a></em>. If the characters brush away the dust, someone can spot the glyph with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check.<br /><br />The glyph triggers the first time a living creature passes over it. Triggering it activates a <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"NDA1YzkwYzEwNDk0\">major image</a></em> spell, conjuring an illusion of Strahd von Zarovich that appears either halfway up the stairs leading to <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"YWUwMjk4ZDM0NDI1\">area K72</a> or halfway down the stairs leading to area K78, so that the vampire appears in front of the triggering character. When &ldquo;Strahd&rdquo; appears, read:<br /><br /></p>\n<blockquote>A sickly mist fills the stairway ahead, then coalesces into the form of the vampire Strahd, his eyes burning red with anger. &ldquo;You have worn out your welcome,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Whatever gods you believe in cannot save you now!&rdquo;</blockquote>\n<p><br />Have the characters roll initiative. Any attack or spell that hits &ldquo;Strahd&rdquo; passes through, revealing that he is an illusion. On initiative count 0, the illusory vampire chuckles and melts away like a wax doll in a bonfire, leaving no trace behind, and the glyph disappears.<br /><br /></p>\n<hr />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>K80. Center Stair</h3>\n<p>If the characters enter this area through the door at the bottom of the stairs, read:<br /><br /></p>\n<blockquote>The door creaks open to reveal a stone staircase between rough masonry walls. There is little dust on the steps, but light fog tumbles down the steps from above.</blockquote>\n<p><br />If the characters enter this area at the top of the staircase, read:<br /><br /></p>\n<blockquote>The rough-hewn corridor ends at a stone staircase that descends to the south. Flanked by walls of rough masonry and relatively free of dust, these stairs descend before ending at a lonely door.</blockquote>\n<p><br />The stairs slope at a 45-degree angle for a distance of 20 feet horizontally, connecting areas K78 and K81.<br /><br /></p>\n<hr />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>K81. Tunnel</h3>\n<blockquote>This tunnel is cut into the Pillarstone of Ravenloft itself. Its surface is slick, and its ceiling is barely 6 feet high. A lingering fog limits visibility to a few feet.</blockquote>\n<p><br />Characters who have knowledge of stonecutting can tell that this passage is a relatively new construction compared to other areas of Ravenloft. The tunnel is 120 feet long, with a stone door at its eastern end.<br /><br />Near the midpoint of the tunnel is a trapdoor hidden under a layer of fog. Characters can&rsquo;t spot the trapdoor passively, but an active search accompanied by a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check locates it. Unless the trapdoor is fastened shut with an iron spike or by some other means, it opens when 100 pounds of weight or more is placed on it. When the trapdoor opens, everyone who is standing on it slides into the marble chute below (area K82). The trapdoor then resets.<br /><br /><strong>WORLD BUILDER NOTE </strong>: As GM you alone see the trap note, when you want to trigger the trap all the player in the red area will be send down to K74e when you clic on the Trap note</p>\n<section class=\"secret\"><hr /><br />\n<h3>K82. Marble Slide</h3>\nIf one or more characters fall through the trapdoor in area K81, read:<br /><br />\n<blockquote>You fall into a chute of polished black marble and slide into the darkness.</blockquote>\n<br />The chute plunges from the trapdoor in area K81 through a one-way secret door into a flooded cell (area K74e). Characters who slide all the way to the bottom are deposited in the cell, but take no damage. The slide contains no handholds and is too slippery to ascend without the aid of magic.<br /><br /><hr /><br />\n<h3>K83. Spiral Stair</h3>\n<blockquote>Behind the door lies a dark spiral staircase.</blockquote>\nThe staircase starts at <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"YzI0YTFjYTVjY2Jh\">area K78</a>, climbs to a landing at area K83a, and continues upward to <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"ZTM3NDAwZGFhNGE5\">area K37</a>.<br /><br /><hr /><br />\n<h3>K83a. Spiral Stair Landing</h3>\nAn extension of area K83, this landing is shown on map 11.<br /><br />\n<blockquote>This forty-foot-long corridor connects two spiral stairways, one leading up and the other descending into the depths of Castle Ravenloft. Hanging from an iron rod bolted to the eastern wall is a dusty, ten-foot-square tapestry depicting knights on horseback charging across a battlefield under a bloodred sky. The lead knight rides a black horse and wears a fur-lined black cloak, dark gray armor, and a visored helm shaped like a wolf&rsquo;s head. His sword glows with the light of the sun.</blockquote>\n<br />The stairs at the north end of the west wall descends to a door leading to <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"YzI0YTFjYTVjY2Jh\">area K78</a>. The stairs at the south end of the west wall lead up, ending at door that opens into <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"ZTM3NDAwZGFhNGE5\">area K37</a>.<br /><br />\n<h4>Treasure</h4>\nThe tapestry depicts Strahd&rsquo;s father, King Barov, leading his fearsome knights into glorious battle. The tapestry weighs 10 pounds and is worth 750 gp intact. If it becomes damaged while in the party&rsquo;s possession, it is worthless unless mended.<br /><br /><hr /><br />\n<h3>K84. Catacombs</h3>\n<blockquote>Buried deep beneath the keep of Ravenloft lie ancient catacombs, with arched ceilings supported by wide, hollow columns that double as crypts. Cobwebs hang limp in the musty air. A thick fog clings to the floor, which is covered in putrid waste. The black ceiling is moving.</blockquote>\n<br />The catacombs fill an area roughly 110 feet east to west by 180 feet north to south, and the floor is covered in several inches of bat guano. The catacombs are made up of 10-foot-wide arched walkways running between 10-foot-square crypts, which serve as pillars that support the 20-foot-high ceiling. The area has five means of entry and exit:<br /><br />\n<ul>\n<li>The door adjacent to crypt 1 (connecting with area K81)</li>\n<li>A barred archway to the north (connecting with area K85)</li>\n<li>A barred archway to the south (connecting with area K86 but warded by teleport traps)</li>\n<li>A barred archway to the east (connecting with area K87)</li>\n<li>The high tower stair (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"ZmU0Yjk2NzNiY2U4\">area K18</a>) or the shaft (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"ZmU0Yjk2NzNiY2U4\">area K18a</a>) to the west</li>\n</ul>\n<br />Each crypt is sealed with a chiseled stone &ldquo;door&rdquo;&mdash;actually a tight-fitting stone slab measuring 3 feet wide, 5 feet tall, and 3 inches thick. Removing or resetting a stone slab requires an action and a successful DC 15 Strength check.<br /><br />Each crypt houses the remains of the person or persons whose epitaph is inscribed on the front of the slab. The crypts are described in the following sections, their epitaphs noted under the crypt&rsquo;s number in italics.<br /><br />Unless noted otherwise, each crypt contains a 3-foot-by-6-foot rectangular bier of marble, 3 feet high, with a skeleton draped in rags lying atop it.<br /><br />The catacombs are home to tens of thousands of bats. The bats hang here during daytime hours and fly out in the evening through the high tower&rsquo;s central shaft (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"ZmU0Yjk2NzNiY2U4\">area K18a</a>) to hunt at night. They will not attack intruders unless they are provoked or are specifically commanded to do so by <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"ZTZiYzA5N2ViNTZi\">Strahd</a>. If one or more bats within a 10-foot square on the map are attacked or caught in the area of a harmful spell, 2d4 <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"NjVhZTI3NTMzNjMz\">swarms of bats</a></strong> form in that area and attack. No more swarms can be formed in that square until the next dawn, when more bats arrive to replenish those that were killed.<br /><br />\n<h4>Teleport Traps</h4>\nInvisible teleport traps are located between crypts 37 and 38, between crypt 37 and the wall south of it, and between crypt 38 and the wall south of it. The traps can&rsquo;t be perceived except with a <em>detect magic</em> spell, which reveals an aura of conjuration magic in the trapped areas. Although the traps can&rsquo;t be disarmed, a successful casting of <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"MGIwMTBiN2M3ODM2\">dispel magic</a></em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"MGIwMTBiN2M3ODM2\"> </a>(DC 16) on a trap suppresses its magic for 1 minute, allowing characters to move safely through its area. A trap is also suppressed while wholly or partly in the area of an <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"Y2Y4MDhmZjhhMTgx\">antimagic field</a></em>.<br /><br />These teleport traps form a protective ring around the entrance to Strahd&rsquo;s tomb (area K86). Any creature that enters one of these 10-foot-square spaces is instantly teleported away, switching places with one of the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"YzUzY2VhZmYxZDFh\">wights</a> in crypt 14. The wight materializes in the creature&rsquo;s previous location and attacks any living creature it sees.<br /><br />\n<h4>Crypt 1</h4>\n<em>Herein lie the ones who walk the path of pain and torment<br /></em><br />The stone door connects not with a crypt, but with a hewn tunnel of stone (area K81).<br /><br />\n<h4>Crypt 2</h4>\n<em>Artista DeSlop &mdash; Court Ceiling Painter</em><br /><br />\n<blockquote>The domed ceiling of this crypt is painted with an image of imps holding bouquets of colorful flowers. A skeleton draped in rags lies atop a marble slab in the center of the crypt. A wooden box is tucked under one bony hand.</blockquote>\n<br />The box is unlocked. It contains seven wood-handled paintbrushes and seven small gourds of dried-up paint.<br /><br />\n<h4>Crypt 3</h4>\n<em>Lady Isolde Yunk (Isolde the Incredible): Purveyor of antiques and imports</em><br /><br />\n<blockquote>A skeleton draped in rags lies atop a marble slab in the center of the crypt. Piled all around it, covering the floor, are heaps of old baskets, braziers, bundled tapestries, candlesticks, chairs, chests, cooking utensils, cressets, curtain rods, decanters, dishes, jugs, lamps, scroll cases, tankards, and tinderboxes. None of the junk looks valuable. An old chandelier hangs from the domed ceiling.</blockquote>\n<br />Characters could spend hours searching the crypt. Though the antiques here might fetch a fair amount of coin, they are hardly worth the trouble to transport.<br /><br />\n<h4>Crypt 4</h4>\n<em>Prince Ariel du Plumette (Ariel the Heavy)<br /></em><br />If the characters open the door to this crypt, read:<br /><br />\n<blockquote>The apparition of a large, rotund man forms within the dark crypt, its eyes wild with insanity. Large, artificial wings unfold from its back.</blockquote>\n<br />Prince Ariel was a terrible man who longed to fly. He attached artificial wings to a harness and empowered the device with magic, but the apparatus still couldn&rsquo;t bear his weight, and he plunged from the Pillarstone of Ravenloft to his death. His evil <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"ZjE4ZDk1Y2JmOGY2\">ghost</a></strong> attacks the characters on sight. If Ariel succeeds in possessing a character, his host climbs the high tower (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"ZmU0Yjk2NzNiY2U4\">area K18</a>) until it reaches the peak (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"M2JjYzQ4NTk1NjM1\">area K59</a>), then hurls itself down the tower&rsquo;s central shaft (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"ZmU0Yjk2NzNiY2U4\">area K18a</a>), screaming, &ldquo;I can fly!&rdquo; the whole way down.<br /><br />\n<h4>Crypt 5</h4>\n<em>Artank Swilovich: Friend and member of the Barovian Wine Distillers Guild</em><br /><br />\n<blockquote>You are greeted by the faint smell of wine. A skeleton draped in rags lies atop a marble slab in the center of the crypt. Heaped around it, covering the entire floor, are thousands of empty wine bottles.</blockquote>\n<br />Each bottle&rsquo;s label shows that it is from the Wizard of Wines winery, and the label names the wine inside: Champagne du le Stomp, Red Dragon Crush, or Purple Grapemash No. 3.<br /><br />\n<h4><span style=\"color: #632423;\">Fortunes of Ravenloft</span></h4>\nIf your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it is buried under the wine bottles. A character who searches under the bottles finds the treasure automatically.<br /><br />\n<h4>Crypt 6</h4>\n<em>Saint Markovia: Dead for all time</em><br /><br />The 10-foot-square section of floor in front of this crypt is a pressure plate that releases four <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"ODFlYzEwNDYxYTUy\">poison darts</a> hidden in tiny holes in the north wall. The trap resets when the weight is lifted and can be triggered a total of four times before its supply of darts is depleted.<br /><br />If the door to the crypt is opened, read:<br /><br />\n<blockquote>This crypt smells of roses. The remains atop its marble slab have disintegrated, except for one thighbone.</blockquote>\n<br />If the characters disturb Saint Markovia&rsquo;s remains, add:<br /><br />\n<blockquote>A ghostly form appears above the dust, so faint that you can barely discern more than part of a face. From this apparition comes the faintest of whispers: &ldquo;The vampire must be destroyed. Use me as your weapon.&rdquo; With that, it fades away.</blockquote>\n<br /><strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> A <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"ZGFkZjk1MTVlNDI3\">detect magic</a></em> spell reveals that the thighbone radiates an aura of evocation magic. See the handout for more information on <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"MmRkYWVhNGU5Y2Ri\">Saint Markovia&rsquo;s thighbone</a></em>.<br /><br />\n<h4>Crypt 7</h4>\n<blockquote>The stone door of this crypt lies on the floor, its inscription obscured by fog. The crypt gapes open. A skull, some bones, and a few bits of rusted armor lie atop a marble slab with a leering stone gargoyle squatting at each end.</blockquote>\n<br />The epitaph on the door reads &ldquo;Endorovich (Endorovich the Terrible): What the blood of a hundred wars did not do, the spurn of a woman accomplished.&rdquo;<br /><br />Endorovich was a ruthless soldier and self-aggrandizing noble who loved a woman named Marya, but she loved another man. As Marya and her lover were dining, Endorovich put poison into the man&rsquo;s wineglass. The glasses were mixed up, and Marya drank the poison instead. The lover was hanged for murdering Marya and buried at the Ivlis River crossroads (chapter 2, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"NDFhNjJjZDAyMGU3\">area F</a>). Endorovich never got over his guilt and, out of madness, killed many in his lifetime.<br /><br />Endorovich&rsquo;s spirit is trapped inside one of the gargoyles. If anyone disturbs the bones on the slab, one of the <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"Zjk5ZTQzYzVjMDRk\">spirit gargoyles</a></strong> awakens and attacks. If the gargoyle is reduced to 0 hit points, Endorovich&rsquo;s spirit moves to the second gargoyle, which then awakens and attacks. Once the second spirit gargoyle is destroyed, Endorovich&rsquo;s spirit is laid to rest.<br /><br />\n<h4><span style=\"color: #632423;\">Fortunes of Ravenloft</span></h4>\nIf your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it is contained in a secret compartment under Endorovich&rsquo;s remains. Once his bones and dust are swept away, the compartment can be found and opened without an ability check.<br /><br />\n<h4>Crypt 8</h4>\n<em>Duchess Dorfniya Dilisnya<br /></em><br />\n<blockquote>A skeleton draped in rags lies atop a marble slab in the center of the crypt. Hanging on the back wall is a handsome quilt that depicts a royal feast.</blockquote>\n<br />The quilt is magically preserved but not valuable.<br /><br />\n<h4>Crypt 9</h4>\n<em>Pidlwick &mdash; Fool of Dorfniya</em><br /><br />\n<blockquote>A small skeleton wearing the remains of a fool&rsquo;s costume lies atop a stumpy marble slab in the center of the crypt.</blockquote>\n<br />If <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"OGI5MzY5ZWEzMmQ4\">Pidlwick II</a> (see <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"M2JjYzQ4NTk1NjM1\">area K59</a>) is with the party, it refuses to enter the crypt. The slab in this crypt is 4 feet long (instead of the usual 6 feet long). The bones atop the slab belong to the fool servant of Duchess Dorfniya Dilisnya (see crypt 8).<br /><br /><strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> If the characters explore this crypt after summoning the ghost of Pidlwick in <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"ZTM3NDAwZGFhNGE5\">area K36</a>, they find a small, flat wooden box on the marble slab next to Pidlwick&rsquo;s bones. The box contains a full <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"MDlkYWVkZjgxNDJl\">deck of illusions</a></em>.<br /><br />\n<h4>Crypt 10</h4>\n<em>Sir Leonid Krushkin (Sir Lee the Crusher): Bigger than life, he loved his jewelry<br /></em><br />\n<blockquote>An oversized skeleton draped in jewelry and rags lies atop an elongated marble slab in the center of the crypt. Leaning against the slab is a bloodstained maul strung with cobwebs.</blockquote>\n<br />Sir Lee stood well over seven feet tall. His maul might give the characters pause, but it is harmless and nonmagical.<br /><br /><strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> Three jeweled necklaces (worth 750 gp each) are lying across Sir Lee&rsquo;s skeleton.<br /><br />\n<h4>Crypt 11</h4>\n<em>Tasha Petrovna &mdash; Healer of Kings, Light unto the West, Servant, Companion<br /></em><br />\n<blockquote>A skeleton wearing tattered priestly vestments lies atop a marble slab in the center of the crypt. The domed ceiling overhead is painted with a glorious sun mural.</blockquote>\n<br />Creatures that would take damage from exposure to sunlight (such as vampires) have disadvantage on all ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws while inside this crypt.<br /><br /><strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> Draped around the neck of the skeleton is a sun-shaped holy symbol (worth 25 gp). A good-aligned character who picks up the holy symbol hears a ghostly female voice. It whispers the following message:<br /><br />\n<blockquote>&ldquo;There is a grave to the west, with roses that never die, in a place built by healers, in a village called Krezk. When all turns to darkness, touch this holy symbol to the grave to summon the light and find a treasure long lost.&rdquo;</blockquote>\n<br />The message refers to a gravestone in the Abbey of Saint Markovia (chapter 8, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"MmIyZjFmYmJlZDZj\">area S7</a>).<br /><br />\n<h4>Crypt 12</h4>\n<em>King Troisky &mdash; The Three-Faced King<br /></em><br />\n<blockquote>There are no bones atop the marble slab in this crypt, only a steel helm with a visor shaped like an angry face.</blockquote>\n<br />The helm has three evenly spaced visors crafted to look like human faces&mdash;one sad, one happy, and one angry. Only the angry visage is visible from the crypt&rsquo;s doorway. King Troisky wore this three-faced helm in battle, earning him the moniker of Three-Faced King. The helm is nonmagical and weighs 10 pounds.<br /><br />The slab upon which the helm rests is weight-sensitive. If the helm is removed from the slab without 10 pounds of weight immediately being added, poisonous gas pours out of the slab&rsquo;s hollow interior and fills the crypt. A character who searches the slab for traps and succeeds on a DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check spots tiny holes bored into the slab&rsquo;s marble base. It&rsquo;s from these holes that the gas spews forth.<br /><br />A creature in the crypt when the gas is released must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.<br /><br />\n<h4>Crypt 13</h4>\n<em>King Katsky (Katsky the Bright): Ruler, inventor, and self-proclaimed time traveler<br /></em><br />\n<blockquote>A skeleton draped in rags lies atop a marble slab in the center of the crypt. Lying amid the bones is a stoppered drinking horn, a fat pouch, and a weird-looking scepter made of metal and wood. Above the bones, hanging from the domed ceiling by wires, is a wooden flying contraption that looks like a set of folding dragon wings fitted with leather straps, metal buckles, and taut leather wing flaps.</blockquote>\n<br />The stoppered drinking horn is a water-resistant powder horn loaded with gunpowder, and the &ldquo;weird-looking scepter&rdquo; is a musket. The fat pouch contains 20 silver marbles (silvered bullets for the musket). For more information, see <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"OTRmODU5ZmRjMjEx\">firearms</a> and <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"MWM4YzlhNGNhOWZi\">explosives</a>.<br /><br /><strong><em>Glider.</em></strong> Any Small or Medium humanoid can wear the dragon-wing glider. (It takes 1 minute to don or doff the glider.) It can&rsquo;t support more than 80 pounds, although the amount of weight it can carry is not evident. A character who inspects the glider in an attempt to discern its maximum weight allowance can do so accurately with a successful DC 15 Intelligence check.<br /><br />If its wearer is light enough (accounting for gear), the apparatus can be used to glide, but only in wide-open spaces where there is room to maneuver. The wearer can become airborne by stepping or jumping off a high place, or by performing a high jump to take off from level ground. While aloft, the wearer gains a flying speed equal to its walking speed, with the following limitations: except in a significant updraft, the wearer can&rsquo;t use the glider to gain altitude, and the glider descends 1 foot for every 10 feet of horizontal distance covered. At the end of the flight, the wearer lands on its feet and the glider is intact. If the wearer tries to accelerate the rate of descent, the glider breaks, and the wearer falls.<br /><br />The glider has AC 12, 1 hit point, and a 15-foot wingspan. Any damage causes it to break and become inoperable. A <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"NzI0YmVlNmJhMmRi\">mending</a></em> cantrip can repair the damage, provided all the broken pieces are present.<br /><br />\n<h4>Crypt 14</h4>\n<em>Stahbal Indi-Bhak: A truer friend no ruler ever had. Here lies his family in honor.<br /></em><br />If the characters open the door to this crypt, read:<br /><br />\n<blockquote>A ten-foot-square shaft plunges into darkness. The sound of slowly dripping water echoes up the shaft.</blockquote>\n<br />Characters who have darkvision or a sufficient light source can see that the shaft descends 40 feet to some kind of vault deep in the Pillarstone of Ravenloft. Stones protrude from the shaft at regular intervals, offering handholds and footholds. The stones are slippery, however, so a character who tries to scale the wall without the aid of magic or the use of a climber&rsquo;s kit must make a successful DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check.<br /><br /><strong>WORLD BUILDER NOTE: </strong>GM you alone see the note on the map to pull up the character when he succeed the check.<br /><br /><strong><em>Vault.</em></strong> When the characters reach the bottom of the shaft, read:<br /><br />\n<blockquote>At the bottom of the shaft is a dank vault with a ten-foot-high ceiling. The room is awkwardly shaped and smells of rotten meat. Fifteen stone coffins are scattered throughout the vault, all oriented with their heads pointed north. The floor is covered with human bones and rusty swords.</blockquote>\n<br />If a character teleports into a coffin from one of the teleport traps that protect Strahd&rsquo;s tomb (area K86), read the following to that character&rsquo;s player:<br /><br />\n<blockquote>A flash of light explodes around you, and then you are plunged into absolute darkness, suddenly lying in a confined space choked with dust.</blockquote>\n<br />This vault contains fifteen <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"YzUzY2VhZmYxZDFh\">wights</a></strong> (one per coffin), minus any that have been teleported away (see &ldquo;Teleport Traps&rdquo; at the start of this section). Lifting a coffin&rsquo;s lid requires an action and a successful DC 15 Strength check.<br /><br />Each wight remains inactive until it is teleported away or until its coffin is opened, whereupon it attacks.<br /><br />The bones and rusty swords cover the floor to a depth of 6 inches, and are the remains of servants who swore to avenge Stahbal Indi-Bhak&rsquo;s family. Whenever a wight is killed in this vault, some of the bones knit together, forming 2d6 animated human <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"OGFjZjBlMWM5YWU0\">skeletons</a></strong>. These skeletons attack intruders on sight but have no ranged attacks. There are enough bones and swords in the room for one hundred skeletons to form in this manner.<br /><br /><br />\n<h4>Crypt 15</h4>\n<em>Khazan: His word was power</em><br /><br />\n<blockquote>A skeleton draped in rags lies atop a marble slab in the center of the crypt. The skull has black opals set in its eye sockets and shards of amber where its teeth should be.</blockquote>\n<br />Khazan was a powerful archmage who unlocked the secrets of lichdom, then later tried to become a demilich and failed. Neither his skull nor his bones pose any threat, but the gems embedded in the skull are valuable.<br /><br /><strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> The skull&rsquo;s black opal eye-gems are worth 1,000 gp apiece. The skull also has eight amber teeth worth 100 gp each.<br /><br />Any creature that stands inside the crypt and boldly speaks the name &ldquo;Khazan&rdquo; causes the Pillarstone of Ravenloft to tremble as a <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"NjZiM2QyNTk0Yjc4\">staff of power</a></em> materializes above the marble slab and hovers in place. The first creature to grab hold of the staff must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 44 (8d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Afterward, the <em>staff of power</em> can be held and used normally. If no one grabs the staff within 1 round of its appearance, it vanishes, never to return.<br /><br />\n<h4>Crypt 16</h4>\n<em>Elsa Fallona von Twitterberg (Beloved Actor): She had many followers<br /></em><br />\n<blockquote>A skeleton draped in rags lies atop a marble slab in the center of the crypt. Nine shallow alcoves are carved into the surrounding walls. The back wall of each alcove is painted with a full-body image of a handsome man. Some of the men wear fine clothes; others wear armor. At the feet of each painting rests a skull atop a pile of bones.</blockquote>\n<br />The bones in the niches belong to Elsa&rsquo;s nine consorts. There is nothing of value here.<br /><br />\n<h4>Crypt 17</h4>\n<em>Sir Sedrik Spinwitovich (Admiral Spinwitovich): Confused though he was, he built the greatest naval force ever assembled in a landlocked country</em><br /><br />\n<blockquote>An eleven-foot-long funeral barge dominates this crypt, wedged diagonally into the available space. Lying in the boat is a skeleton draped in rags, with hundreds of gold coins piled around it.</blockquote>\n<br />The coins are made of clay painted gold and are worthless. The funeral barge, which was assembled inside the crypt, is too big to fit through the door.<br /><br />\n<h4>Crypt 18</h4>\nThe stone door of this crypt has been carefully laid to one side. Through the swirly mists of the perpetual fog, freshly engraved letters spell out the words &ldquo;Ireena Kolyana: Wife.&rdquo;<br /><br />The crypt is empty and has been swept clean. This is where Strahd intends to keep Ireena once he turns her into a vampire spawn.<br /><br />\n<h4>Crypt 19</h4>\n<em>Artimus (Builder of the Keep): Thou standest amidst the monument to his life<br /></em><br />\n<blockquote>A skeleton draped in rags lies atop a marble slab in the center of the crypt.</blockquote>\n<br />This crypt contains nothing of interest.<br /><br />\n<h4>Crypt 20</h4>\n<em>Sasha Ivliskova &mdash; Wife<br /></em><br />\n<blockquote>Webs as thick and pale as linen cover a shapely female form lying atop a marble slab in the center of this dusty, web-filled crypt. You hear a voice issue from the darkness.<br /><br />&ldquo;My love, have you come to set me free?&rdquo;<br /><br />The woman rises, the shroud of webs clinging to her in a ghastly fashion.</blockquote>\n<br />This <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"YWM4NmJjYmJiMGE1\">vampire spawn</a></strong> is an old wife of Strahd&rsquo;s. Once she realizes that the characters aren&rsquo;t her husband, Sasha tears away her web shroud like an unloved wedding dress and attacks.<br /><br />\n<h4>Crypt 21</h4>\n<em>Patrina Velikovna &mdash; Bride<br /></em><br />The creature inside this crypt attacks as soon as the door is opened.<br /><br />\n<blockquote>From the darkness comes a horrifying visage, a spectral elf maiden twisted by the horror of her undead existence. She wails, and the very sound claws at your soul.</blockquote>\n<br />The spectral elf is a <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"N2EyYjA0OTBjODhk\">banshee</a></strong> that attacks the characters on sight, using her wail immediately. Once awakened, the banshee is free to roam Castle Ravenloft, but she can&rsquo;t travel more than 5 miles from this crypt.<br /><br />In life, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"NjcyNWRkZmY0YzFi\">Patrina Velikovna</a> was a dusk elf who, having learned a great deal about the black arts, was nearly a match for Strahd&rsquo;s powers. She felt a great bond with him and asked to solemnize that bond in a dark marriage. Drawn to her knowledge and power, Strahd consented, but before he could drain all life from Patrina, her own people stoned her to death in an act of mercy to thwart Strahd&rsquo;s plans. Strahd demanded, and got, Patrina&rsquo;s body. She then became the banshee trapped here.<br /><br />Reducing the banshee to 0 hit points causes it to discorporate. Patrina&rsquo;s spirit can&rsquo;t rest, however, until she is formally wed to Strahd; the banshee re-forms in her crypt 24 hours later. Casting a <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"ZTBlNjg0MDYwNmE0\">hallow</a></em> spell on the crypt prevents the banshee from returning for as long as the spell lasts.<br /><br /><strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> Read the following text when the characters investigate Patrina&rsquo;s crypt:<br /><br />\n<blockquote>In the center of the crypt, a skeleton draped in rags lies atop a marble slab, surrounded by thousands of coins.</blockquote>\n<br />Patrina&rsquo;s crypt contains 250 pp, 1,100 gp, 2,300 ep, 5,200 sp, and 8,000 cp. The coins are of a mixed origin. The platinum and electrum coins have Strahd&rsquo;s profiled visage stamped on them. Buried under the coins is Patrina&rsquo;s spellbook, which has carved wooden covers. It contains all the spells listed for the <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"ZTJhMjMzMjExYTVm\">archmage</a></strong>.<br /><br /><strong><em>Development.</em></strong> If she is restored to life by her brother (see &ldquo;Kasimir&rsquo;s Dark Gift&rdquo; in <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"Yjc1MDc2NmNiYzQ1\">Special Events: Chapter 13</a>), <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"NjcyNWRkZmY0YzFi\">Patrina</a> (NE female dusk elf) returns with no spells prepared. If the characters have her spellbook, she kindly asks them to give it back to her so that she can prepare her long-forgotten spells and help destroy Strahd (a lie). If the characters oblige, she repays their kindness by learning as much about them as possible before pursuing her own goals.<br /><br />\n<h4>Crypt 22</h4>\n<em>Sir Erik Vonderbucks<br /></em><br />A gilded man lies atop a marble slab in the center of this otherwise barren crypt.<br /><br />\n<blockquote>Sir Erik Vonderbucks was a wealthy noble whose dying wish was to have his corpse dipped in molten gold.</blockquote>\n<br /><strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> The thin layer of gold, if peeled from Sir Erik&rsquo;s desiccated corpse, is worth 500 gp.<br /><br />\n<h4>Crypt 23</h4>\nThe first time the characters happen upon this crypt, they see one of their names (determined randomly) etched into the door. Opening the crypt releases a horrid stench of decay and reveals a corpse lying on the marble slab within. The corpse looks like the character named on the door. Touching the corpse causes it to melt away, whereupon the inscription fades. On later visits to this crypt, the door is unmarked and the crypt is empty.<br /><br />\n<h4>Crypt 24</h4>\n<em>Ivan Ivliskovich, Champion of Winter Dog Racing: The race may go to the swift, but vengeance is for the loser&rsquo;s relatives</em><br /><br />\n<blockquote>A skeleton draped in bits of fur lies atop a marble slab in the center of the crypt. The walls and ceiling are covered with plaster painted to make the crypt seem as if it stands in an evergreen forest, surrounded by snow. The plaster has peeled and fallen away in many places, shattering the illusion.</blockquote>\n<br />This crypt contains nothing of interest.<br /><br />\n<h4>Crypt 25</h4>\n<em>Stefan Gregorovich: First Counselor to King Barov von Zarovich<br /></em><br />\n<blockquote>A skeleton draped in rags lies atop a marble slab in the center of the crypt. Most of the bones appear dusty and neglected, but the skull is well polished.</blockquote>\n<br />A <em>detect magic</em> spell cast here reveals that Stefan&rsquo;s skull radiates a faint aura of necromancy magic. As long as the skull remains in the crypt, it will answer up to five questions put to it, as though a <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"ZDNhMzU2YjFhNzBk\">speak with dead</a></em> spell had been cast on it. This property recharges each day at dawn. In life, Stefan was neither observant nor well informed. If the skull is questioned about Strahd or Castle Ravenloft, all the information it provides is untrue.<br /><br />\n<h4>Crypt 26</h4>\n<em>Intree Sik-Valoo: He spurned wealth for the knowledge he could take to heaven<br /></em><br />\n<blockquote>A skeleton draped in rags lies atop a marble slab in the center of the crypt. Most of the bones appear dusty and neglected, but the skull is well polished.</blockquote>\n<br />A <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"ZGFkZjk1MTVlNDI3\">detect magic</a></em> spell cast here reveals that Intree&rsquo;s skull radiates a faint aura of necromancy magic. As long as the skull remains in the crypt, it will answer up to five questions put to it, as though a <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"ZDNhMzU2YjFhNzBk\">speak with dead</a></em> spell had been cast on it. This property recharges each day at dawn. Unlike Stefan Gregorovich in crypt 25, Intree was well educated and astute. If the skull is questioned about Strahd or the castle, the information it provides is true.<br /><br />\n<h4>Crypt 27</h4>\n<blockquote>This crypt is missing its door.</blockquote>\n<br />Three <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"ZDNlMDNlNDczOGJi\">giant wolf spiders</a></strong> infest this otherwise empty crypt. The spiders make no noise and leap out to attack anyone who moves in front of the crypt&rsquo;s gaping doorway.<br /><br />\n<h4>Crypt 28</h4>\n<em>Bascal Ofenheiss &mdash; Chef Deluxe<br /></em><br />\n<blockquote>A skeleton draped in white linen lies atop a marble slab in the center of the crypt, clutching a bell to its sunken chest. Fitted over its skull is a tall chef&rsquo;s hat.</blockquote>\n<br />If the bell is rung inside the crypt, magic fire sweeps through the crypt to scorch Chef Ofenheiss&rsquo;s bones. A creature in the crypt must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) fire damage on a failed save, or half damage on a successful one. Any creature that fails its save catches fire, taking 5 (1d10) fire damage at the end of each of its turns until it or another creature uses an action to douse the flames.<br /><br /><strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> Tucked under the chef&rsquo;s hat is an electrum spork with a bejeweled handle (worth 250 gp).<br /><br />\n<h4>Crypt 29</h4>\n<em>Baron Eisglaze Dr&uuml;f<br /></em><br />\n<blockquote>Opening the door causes the air around you to turn as cold as the coldest hell you can imagine. Every surface inside the crypt is covered with thick, brownish mold.</blockquote>\n<br />A patch of <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"NDg2OWJiMzg2ZWEx\">brown mold</a> fills the crypt. Characters within 5 feet of the crypt&rsquo;s open doorway are affected.<br /><br />If the brown mold is killed off, characters can dig through the moldy crust to find the bones of Baron Dr&uuml;f lying atop a marble slab.<br /><br /><strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> Hidden under the brown mold next to the baron&rsquo;s bones is a <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"NzNjNTIyYjg3NTFm\">luck blade</a></em> with one wish remaining. If a creature uses the wish to try to escape from Barovia, the spell fails. If a creature uses the sword to wish for Strahd&rsquo;s destruction, the wish doesn&rsquo;t destroy <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"ZTZiYzA5N2ViNTZi\">Strahd</a> but rather teleports him to within 5 feet of the sword.<br /><br />\n<h4>Crypt 30</h4>\n<em>Prefect Ciril Romulich (Beloved of King Barov and Queen Ravenovia): High Priest of the Most Holy Order<br /></em><br />\n<blockquote>A marble slab in the center of the crypt displays a skeleton draped in red vestments, a golden holy symbol clutched in one bony hand. The domed ceiling fifteen feet above is painted to look like a canopy of trees with bright autumn leaves. A narrow stone ledge encircles the crypt ten feet above the floor. Perched on it are dozens of stone ravens, their eyes fixed on the marble slab.</blockquote>\n<br />The carved ravens are ominous yet harmless.<br /><br /><strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> The prefect&rsquo;s gold holy symbol is festooned with tiny gemstones and is worth 750 gp. If touched by an evil creature, the holy symbol is consumed in a blast of intense light that deals 11 (2d10) radiant damage to all creatures within 5 feet of it. Characters familiar with Barovian religion recognize the symbol as that of the Morninglord.<br /><br />\n<h4>Crypt 31</h4>\n<em>We knew him only by his wealth<br /></em><br />\n<blockquote>This crypt is empty. Its walls are painted to depict mountains of gold coins.</blockquote>\n<br />The floor of the crypt is actually the cover of a 30-foot-deep spiked pit. The cover opens if 100 pounds of weight or more are placed on it. It splits down the middle, east to west, and its doors are spring-loaded. After a victim or victims fall into the pit, its doors snap shut. (See <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"MzAyZjkwYjE3ODU2\">Pits</a>.) The spikes at the bottom of the pit are made of iron but aren&rsquo;t poisoned.<br /><br /><strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> A human skeleton (the remains of a dead adventurer) wrapped in bits of studded leather armor lies amid the spikes at the bottom of the pit. A shattered lantern and a rusty crowbar lie nearby. Tied to the corpse&rsquo;s leather belt is a 50-foot coil of hempen rope, a dagger in a worn scabbard, a pouch containing 25 pp, and a stoppered wooden tube containing a <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"MTE4ZDc2ZGNkMWQ3\">spell scroll</a></em> of <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"YjBjMGI5YTBjOTUy\">magic circle</a></em>.<br /><br />\n<h4><span style=\"color: #632423;\">Fortunes of Ravenloft</span></h4>\nIf your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it is lying next to the skeleton at the bottom of the pit.<br /><br />\n<h4>Crypt 32</h4>\n<em>The door to this crypt has no name or epitaph on it.<br /></em><br />\n<blockquote>This crypt is empty except for two alcoves in the back wall. Above the alcoves are carved the following words: <strong>Pass Not These Portals Ye Foolish Mortals</strong></blockquote>\n<br />A <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"ZGFkZjk1MTVlNDI3\">detect magic</a></em> spell reveals that both alcoves radiate strong auras of conjuration magic.<br /><br />Creatures that enter the eastern alcove of this crypt are teleported to the eastern alcove of Strahd&rsquo;s tomb (area K86). Stepping into the western alcove of this crypt has no effect, but any creature that teleports from the western alcove of area K86 appears here.<br /><br />\n<h4>Crypt 33</h4>\n<em>Sir Klutz Tripalotsky: He fell on his own sword<br /></em><br />\n<blockquote>In the center of this crypt, atop a marble slab, human bones lie amid the empty shell of a suit of rusty plate armor. Plunged through the armor&rsquo;s breastplate is a longsword.</blockquote>\n<br />Neither Sir Klutz&rsquo;s armor nor his longsword are magical or valuable.<br /><br />If the sword is pulled from the armor, Sir Klutz appears as a <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"MTIwYWVmYTUyY2Y5\">phantom warrior</a></strong>, thanks whoever pulled his weapon free, and agrees to fight alongside that character for the next seven days. Sir Klutz perished years before Strahd became a vampire, so the phantom warrior knows nothing of Strahd&rsquo;s downfall or the curse afflicting Barovia.<br /><br />\n<h4>Crypt 34</h4>\n<em>King Dostron the Hellborn<br /></em><br />\n<blockquote>Resting in the center of this crypt is a seven-foot-long gilded sarcophagus, its lid painted with the likeness of a screaming king wearing a crown of horns. Looming behind the sarcophagus is a stuffed owlbear frozen in a roar, with claws outstretched.</blockquote>\n<br />King Dostron was an ancient ruler of this land, long before the arrival of Strahd. He claimed descent from a duke of the Nine Hells, and his deeds did justice to this ancestry. His sarcophagus is made of beaten lead and encased in gold (see &ldquo;Treasure&rdquo; below). Its lid can be pried open with a crowbar or similar tool, revealing nothing but dust within. The stuffed owlbear is a late addition to the crypt&rsquo;s decor&mdash;a gift given to Strahd that wound up here. It looks almost alive but is harmless.<br /><br />An invisible <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"NjY2OTI0OWFjZjhk\">imp</a></strong> is perched atop the owlbear. If someone tries to open the sarcophagus, the imp says in Common, &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t do that if I were you!&rdquo; The imp is magically bound to King Dostron&rsquo;s remains and must watch over them for several more centuries before its contract are fulfilled. It isn&rsquo;t obligated to protect the contents of the crypt (so it will not attack), and it delights in telling lies and engaging in mischief. For instance, it warns the characters that the sarcophagus is trapped, and that opening the lid will free a pit fiend bound within.<br /><br /><strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> Characters who take the time to pry the gold from the sarcophagus can amass 500 gp worth of the precious metal, weighing 10 pounds.<br /><br />\n<h4>Crypt 35</h4>\n<em>Sir Jarnwald the Trickster: The joke was on him<br /></em><br />\n<blockquote>A charnel stench fills this empty crypt.</blockquote>\n<br />The floor here is an illusion that hides a 20-foot-deep pit <em>(Note: pit artwork overlay can be moved from the GM Layer to the Map Layer)</em>. The sides of the pit are polished smooth; a creature without a climbing speed can&rsquo;t move along them without the aid of magic or a climber&rsquo;s kit. At the bottom of the pit are six starving <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"ZjEwNjY5MTM3YjE2\">ghouls</a></strong>. A permanent <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"MjkwYTcyZWQ1MjQy\">silence</a></em> spell suppresses sound in the pit. The silence can be dispelled, as can the illusory floor (DC 14 for both).<br /><br /><strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> Sir Jarnwald was &ldquo;entombed&rdquo; here, so far as he was pushed into the crypt and devoured by the ghouls. What remains of him lies scattered on the pit floor: a few scraps of clothing, a handful of teeth, and a signet ring that bears a stylized &ldquo;J&rdquo; (worth 25 gp).<br /><br />\n<h4>Crypt 36</h4>\nClaw marks obliterate the name on this crypt&rsquo;s door.<br /><br />\n<blockquote>A skeleton draped in rags lies atop a marble slab in the center of the crypt.</blockquote>\n<br />This crypt contains nothing of interest.<br /><br />\n<h4>Crypt 37</h4>\n<em>Gralmore Nimblenobs &mdash; Wizard Ordinaire<br /></em><br />\n<blockquote>Lying on a marble slab in the center of this crypt is the corpse of a man with a long white beard. His skin clings tightly to his skull and bones, and he wears dusty red robes. Clutched to his chest is a wooden staff that has a brass knob on one end and a marble knob on the other.</blockquote>\n<br />The staff is a nonmagical quarterstaff.<br /><br />Inspection of the marble slab reveals a shallow, concave recess at one end. If the marble-knobbed end of Gralmore&rsquo;s staff is placed in the recess, the slab levitates 5 feet upward, revealing a compartment underneath (see &ldquo;Treasure&rdquo; below). The slab slowly sinks back into place after 1 minute. If the brass-knobbed end of the staff is placed in the recess, the holder of the staff takes 22 (4d10) lightning damage.<br /><br /><strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> The compartment under the slab holds a small, black leather case containing three <em>spell scrolls</em> (<em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"NzYxZGNlOThhMjQ2\">cone of cold</a></em>, <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"ZTRkNjIxMmM1ZjAx\">fireball</a></em>, and <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"MWI2MzViODk5M2Jh\">lightning bolt</a></em>).<br /><br />\n<h4><span style=\"color: #632423;\">Fortunes of Ravenloft</span></h4>\nIf your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it is in the compartment with the other treasure.<br /><br />\n<h4>Crypt 38</h4>\n<em>General Kroval &ldquo;Mad Dog&rdquo; Grislek (Master of the Hunt): A leader of hounds and men</em><br /><br />When the characters open the door to this crypt, read:<br /><br />\n<blockquote>The stench of brimstone and burnt fur spills from this crypt. In its darkness are three pairs of glowing red eyes.</blockquote>\n<br />Three <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"M2JlMWVjNzkzODg5\">hell hounds</a></strong> lunge forth and attack, fighting to the death. In the round after they attack, General Grislek&rsquo;s <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"N2FlYWQxMzI0OTRj\">wraith</a></strong> emerges from the crypt, uttering commands to the hounds in Infernal. Once these evil creatures are slain, the characters can inspect the crypt more closely.<br /><br />\n<blockquote>Bits of incinerated bone lie strewn atop a marble slab in the center of the crypt. Lying amid the bones are fragments of a shattered spear with a silvered head. The walls and domed ceiling of the crypt are covered with scorched murals that depict legions of infantry and cavalry clashing on battlefields.</blockquote>\n<br />A <em>mending</em> cantrip can repair the spear, which is broken into three pieces of roughly equal length. If repaired, it can be wielded as a silvered, nonmagical spear.<br /><br />\n<h4><span style=\"color: #630000;\">Fortunes of Ravenloft</span></h4>\nIf your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it is in a secret compartment under Grislek&rsquo;s remains. Once his charred bones are cleared away, the compartment can be found and opened without an ability check.<br /><br />\n<h4>Crypt 39</h4>\n<em>Beucephalus, the Wonder Horse: May the flowers grow ever brighter where he trods</em><br /><br />The door to this crypt is larger than all the others, 6 feet wide by 8 feet tall. Removing or resetting the slab requires a successful DC 20 Strength check. When the door is opened, read:<br /><br />\n<blockquote>Dry, hot air and smoke billow from the crypt as a black horse with a flaming mane and fiery hooves emerges. Smoke billows from its nostrils as it rears up to attack.</blockquote>\n<br />The nightmare, <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"ODExZjZlNDdhN2Mw\">Beucephalus</a></strong>, is Strahd&rsquo;s steed. It has 104 hit points. If the characters slay it, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"ZTZiYzA5N2ViNTZi\">Strahd</a> hunts them down mercilessly. When the steed wants to leave the castle, it flies up the central shaft of the high tower (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"ZmU0Yjk2NzNiY2U4\">area K18a</a>), exiting through the gash in the tower roof (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"M2JjYzQ4NTk1NjM1\">area K59</a>).<br /><br />\n<h4>Crypt 40</h4>\n<em>Tatsaul Eris &mdash; Last of the Line<br /></em><br />\n<blockquote>A skeleton draped in rags lies atop a marble slab in the center of the crypt. Mounted on the north, east, and south walls are three unlit torches in iron brackets.</blockquote>\n<br />When a creature enters this tomb for the first time, the torches burst into flame and continue to burn until they are spent or extinguished.<br /><br />Examination of the skull and bones reveals that they are plaster facsimiles.<br /><br /><hr /><br />\n<h3>K85. Sergei&rsquo;s Tomb</h3>\nA portcullis is closed in the archway into this tomb. Lifting it requires a successful DC 25 Strength check.<br /><br />\n<blockquote>White marble steps descend to a tomb that has a vaulted ceiling thirty feet overhead. A stillness&mdash;a calm amid the storm&mdash;is felt here. In the center of the tomb, a white marble slab supports an intricately inlaid coffin. Chiseled into the slab is a name: Sergei von Zarovich. To the north, behind the coffin, are three alcoves. A beautifully carved statue stands in each alcove&mdash;a stunning young man flanked by two angels&mdash;looking as polished and new as the day each was placed there. An iron lever protrudes from the south wall, west of the tomb&rsquo;s entrance.</blockquote>\n<br />Raising the lever lifts the portcullis at the top of the stairs. Pulling it down lowers the portcullis.<br /><br />The coffin opens easily to the touch of a lawful good creature. Otherwise, opening it requires a successful DC 15 Strength check. Sergei&rsquo;s flesh has been magically preserved, and at first glance it looks like he is sleeping in his casket.<br /><br />\n<h4>Treasure</h4>\nSergei&rsquo;s embalmed body is clothed in shining <em>+2 plate armor</em>.<br /><br />\n<h4><span style=\"color: #632423;\">Fortunes of Ravenloft</span></h4>\nIf your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it is inside the coffin next to Sergei&rsquo;s body.<br /><br />If your card reading indicates an encounter with <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"ZTZiYzA5N2ViNTZi\">Strahd</a> in this area, he is lying across Sergei&rsquo;s coffin, weeping.<br /><br /><hr /><br />\n<h3>K86.

Lifting it requires a successful DC 25 Strength check.<br /><br />\n<blockquote>Black marble steps descend to a dark tomb that has a vaulted ceiling thirty feet overhead. The essence of evil permeates the very air. The smell of freshly turned earth is here. Settled into the dirt on the floor is a shining black coffin of finely waxed wood.

An iron lever protrudes from the north wall, east of the tomb&rsquo;s entrance.</blockquote>\n<br />Raising the lever lifts the portcullis at the top of the stairs. Pulling it down lowers the portcullis.<br /><br />Lying under the earth near the east wall of the tomb are three vampire spawn brides (<strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"MTRkOGYwNzM5NTNh\">Ludmilla Vilisevic</a></strong>, <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"ZjQ0ZjhkMDdjZTVj\">Volenta Popofsky</a></strong>, and <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"NTY5NzljN2Y3N2I2\">Anastrasya Karelova</a></strong>) dressed in soiled gowns and wearing dirt-encrusted jewelry (see &ldquo;Treasure&rdquo; below). They rise to attack anyone who approaches Strahd&rsquo;s coffin. <br /><br />A <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"ZGFkZjk1MTVlNDI3\">detect magic</a></em> spell reveals that the western and eastern alcoves radiate strong auras of conjuration magic. The central alcove is nonmagical.<br /><br />Creatures that enter the western alcove are instantly teleported to the western alcove of crypt 32 in area K84. Stepping into the eastern alcove has no effect, but any creature that teleports from the eastern alcove of crypt 32 appears here.<br /><br />\n<h4>Treasure</h4>\nStrahd lavished many fine gifts on his three brides.<br /><br />If you wish to show the characters what they looked like in life, reference <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"MzViNTA5OWMwYzJj\">Handout: Escher and the Brides</a>.<br /><br />Ludmilla Vilisevic wears a soiled white wedding gown, a gold tiara (worth 750 gp), and ten gold bracelets (worth 100 gp each).<br /><br />Anastrasya Karelova wears a stained and tattered red wedding gown, a black and crimson silk head scarf sewn with precious jewels (worth 750 gp), and a platinum necklace with a black opal pendant (worth 1,500 gp).<br /><br />Volenta Popofsky wears a faded gold wedding gown, a platinum mask shaped vaguely like a skull (750 gp), and ten platinum rings set with gemstones (worth 250 gp each).<br /><br />\n<h4>Teleport Destination</h4>\nCharacters who teleport to this location from <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"YzI0YTFjYTVjY2Jh\">area K78</a> arrive at the bottom of the stairs, just inside the tomb.<br /><br />\n<h4><span style=\"color: #632423;\">Fortunes of Ravenloft</span></h4>\nIf your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it lies in the center alcove.<br /><br />If your card reading indicates an encounter with <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"ZTZiYzA5N2ViNTZi\">Strahd</a> in this area, he is in his coffin, ready to attack anyone who opens the lid.<br /><br /><hr /><br />\n<h3>K87.

Within each alcove, taking up the full thirty-foot height of the ceiling, is a bronze statue of a warrior holding a spear. A soft blue curtain of light flows between the two alcoves. Dimly visible on the other side of the curtain are more descending stairs.</blockquote>\n<br />The curtain has no effect on creatures that move east to west (from <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"YzI0YTFjYTVjY2Jh\">area K88</a> to area K84).<br /><br />A creature of lawful good alignment that moves west to east through the curtain can do so without difficulty, but creatures of other alignments that do so are teleported back to the top of the stairs behind them. A Small creature can squeeze behind and around one of the bronze statues to circumvent the light curtain.<br /><br /><hr /><br />\n<h3>K88. Tomb of King Barov and Queen Ravenovia</h3>\n<blockquote>This tomb rests in hushed silence. Tall, stained glass windows dominate the eastern walls, allowing dim light to fall on two coffins resting atop white marble slabs. The one against the north wall is marked King Barov von Zarovich, and the one against the south wall is marked Queen Ravenovia van Roeyen. The vaulted ceiling thirty feet overhead is inlaid with a beautiful gold mosaic.</blockquote>\n<br />The stained glass windows are so dirty on the outside as to be nearly opaque. The windows don&rsquo;t open, but they can be smashed easily. Anyone who looks upward through a window can see, 110 feet above, the castle&rsquo;s stone overlook (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"NTZhOGQwMTVjZmM4\">area K6</a>). Anyone who falls out a window here plummets almost 900 feet to the base of the Pillarstone of Ravenloft.<br /><br />Prying the gold from the ceiling of this tomb would be a long and tedious effort for little reward.<br /><br />The north coffin holds a beautifully sculpted, life-sized wax effigy of Strahd&rsquo;s father, King Barov. The old king&rsquo;s bones lie in a compartment beneath his effigy.<br />The south coffin holds the skeleton of Strahd&rsquo;s mother, Queen Ravenovia. (The magic that was meant to preserve her earthly remains failed years ago.) A tattered white shroud covers her bones.<br /><br />If you wish to show the characters what they looked like in life, reveal <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"OWUzMmVmNjgxNzQz\">Handout: King Barov and Queen Ravenovia</a>.<br /><br />\n<h4><span style=\"color: #632423;\">Fortunes of Ravenloft</span></h4>\nIf your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it lies atop Queen Ravenovia&rsquo;s coffin.<br /><br />If your card reading indicates an encounter with <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"ZTZiYzA5N2ViNTZi\">Strahd</a> in this area, he is in a frenzy of rage and despair.</section>","img":"modules/cor-cos/journal/004_-_Chapter_4_3A_Castle_Ravenloft/008_-_Map_11_3A_Larders_of_Ill_Omen/avatar.webp"}

Ezmerelda&rsquo;s Magic Wagon</h3>\nPicture: <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"MzM2MGRjZWVkYjMy\">Handout: Ezmerelda's Magic Wagon</a><br /><br />Ezmerelda&rsquo;s wagon is parked in front of the tower. If the characters investigate the wagon, read:<br /><br />\n<blockquote>Under layers of mud, this wagon sports a fresh coat of purple paint, and its wheels have fancy gold trim. A brass lantern hangs from each corner, and red drapes cover a tombstone-shaped window on each side. A steel padlock secures the back door, hanging from which is a cheap wooden sign that reads, &ldquo;Keep out!&rdquo;</blockquote>\n<br />The wagon radiates an aura of conjuration magic if it is scrutinized with a <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"ZGFkZjk1MTVlNDI3\">detect magic</a></em> spell. A character who casts an <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"ZTE2YmJjZDliYTYw\">identify</a></em> spell on the wagon learns the command words needed to operate it.<br /><br />Anyone who sits in the driver&rsquo;s seat and speaks its command word (&ldquo;Drovash&rdquo;) summons a pair of quasi-real <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"NDVmYmY0YWQ5OTgx\">draft horses</a>, which are magically tethered to the wagon and can&rsquo;t be separated from it. The horses and wagon have a speed of 30 feet, and the horses heed the driver&rsquo;s simple commands. The driver can dismiss the horses with a second command word (&ldquo;Arvesh&rdquo;). The horses can be dispelled (DC 15) but not harmed.<br /><br />The wagon has a hidden trapdoor in its underbelly that can be detected by a character who scuttles under the wagon and succeeds on a DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check. The trapdoor opens into the wagon and is the only safe way inside.<br /><br />\n<h4>Booby Trap</h4>\nThe inside handle of the door has a wire looped around it, and the wire is connected to a flask of alchemist&rsquo;s fire hanging from the wagon&rsquo;s ceiling. When the door is opened, the flask falls and explodes, igniting one hundred more flasks of alchemist&rsquo;s fire that dangle from wires like ornaments along the wagon&rsquo;s interior walls. A creature within 30 feet of the wagon when it explodes must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, taking 55 (10d10) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures inside the wagon or within 5 feet of it have disadvantage on the saving throw. The wagon is reduced to flinders by the explosion, and the contents of the wagon (see &ldquo;Treasure&rdquo; below) are destroyed as well.<br /><br />A character inside the wagon spots the trap automatically (no ability check required) and can disable it with a successful DC 10 Dexterity check. A failed attempt to disable the trap triggers it.<br /><br />\n<h4>Treasure</h4>\nThe interior of the wagon contains the following items:<br /><br />\n<ul>\n<li>A wooden trunk covered with claw marks that holds a battleaxe, a flail, a morningstar, a light crossbow, and 10 silvered crossbow bolts</li>\n<li>A narrow wardrobe containing three sets of fine clothes, two sets of traveler&rsquo;s clothes, several pairs of shoes, a harlequin mask, and three wigs</li>\n<li>A climber&rsquo;s kit, a disguise kit, a healer&rsquo;s kit, and a poisoner&rsquo;s kit</li>\n<li>A lyre with golden strings (worth 50 gp)</li>\n<li>A sculpted wooden cage holding a chicken and a silver ewer (worth 100 gp) with five chicken eggs in it</li>\n<li>A tiny wooden box containing a deck of tarokka cards (see <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"M2M5MzJhYjk3OGEw\">the tarokka deck</a> handout) wrapped in silk</li>\n<li>A set of copper pots and pans (worth 50 gp)</li>\n<li>Three sets of manacles</li>\n<li>A shovel</li>\n<li>A wooden chest containing a gold holy symbol of the Morninglord (worth 100 gp), three vials of holy water, three vials of perfume, two vials of antitoxin, a 50-foot coil of hempen rope, a tinderbox, a steel mirror, a sharpened wooden stake, and a spyglass</li>\n<li>Two <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"MTE4ZDc2ZGNkMWQ3\"><em>spell scrolls</em></a> (<em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"NDA1YzkwYzEwNDk0\">major image</a></em> and <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"Yzg0NGFmODc4NDdl\">remove curse</a></em>)</li>\n<li>A map of Barovia (showing all the locations marked on this adventure&rsquo;s map of Barovia)</li>\n<li>A charred page from van Richten&rsquo;s journal (show the players &ldquo;<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"NDAzZTI0ZmE4NGM3\">Handout: Journal of Rudolph van Richten</a>&rdquo;).</li>\n</ul>\n<br /><hr /><br />\n<h3>V2. Tower Door</h3>\n<blockquote>The tower door is made of iron, with no visible handles or hinges. In the middle of the door is a large, embossed symbol&mdash;a connected series of lines with eight stick figures set around it. Carved into the lintel above the door is a word: Khazan.</blockquote>\n<br />Show the players the door symbol (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"ZDljZmQ2ZGM1ODA3\">Handout: Tower Door</a>). The door is magically locked and trapped, and the symbol on the door is the key to disabling the trap. Magic that would normally unlock the door is neutralized by the tower&rsquo;s spell drain effect (see &ldquo;Khazan&rsquo;s Spell Drain&rdquo; in <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"ZTNhZWI2NTE3ZDVk\">Approaching the Tower</a>).<br /><br />A creature that touches the door without first disabling the trap causes lightning to envelop the tower. Any creature outside the tower and within 10 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, with disadvantage if it is wearing armor made of metal, taking 22 (4d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half damage on a successful one. As long as the effect persists, any creature that enters the lightning for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there takes 22 (4d10) lightning damage. The lightning lasts for 10 minutes.<br /><br />The third time this trap is triggered, the magic fails and causes the tower to collapse. Each creature inside the tower when it collapses takes 132 (24d10) bludgeoning damage, while those within 20 feet of the tower must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 44 (8d10) bludgeoning damage from falling debris. The collapse not only destroys the tower but also most of its contents, including the animated armor in area V7. The wooden chest in area V7 (as well as the severed head inside it) remains intact but requires 1d8 + 2 hours of digging through rubble to find. The clay golems in area V4 are undamaged but buried under piles of debris. Every hour the characters spend searching through the rubble, they have a 10 percent chance of accidentally unearthing a berserk clay golem.<br /><br />\n<h4>Opening the Door</h4>\nEach stick figure embossed on the door has differently positioned arms&mdash;either bent up or down at the elbow, or sticking straight out to the side. When a creature standing within 5 feet of the door uses an action to imitate the arm positions of all eight stick figures in the proper sequence, the trap is disabled and the door swings open on rusty hinges for 10 minutes. The lines of the symbol on the door reveal the proper sequence. The dance can be performed in one of two ways; a creature must trace the path of the lines, starting at either endpoint. All eight sets of arm positions must be performed, with no repeats, for the sequence to be complete.<br /><br />If the arm positions are done out of order, a <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"Njc5ZmQxNjViZDll\">young blue dragon</a></strong> magically appears within 30 feet of the door and attacks all creatures it can see. The characters can keep trying to open the door while the dragon is attacking them. The dragon disappears if it is reduced to 0 hit points or if the characters open the door.<br /><br />\n<h4>Vestibule</h4>\nBeyond the door is a 5-foot-square vestibule with a tattered curtain that conceals area V4 beyond. The iron door leading outside can be safely opened from this side. It magically closes after 1 minute unless held open.<br /><br /><hr /><br />\n<h3>V3. Rickety Scaffolding</h3>\n<blockquote>Rotting wooden beams support the scaffolding, which groans and creaks with the slightest breeze. A series of ladders and platforms lead to a hole in the northwest wall on the third floor.</blockquote>\n<br />The scaffolding can&rsquo;t support more than 200 pounds of weight. If it collapses, anyone standing on it falls 20 feet to the ground, taking 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10 feet fallen plus an additional 2d6 piercing damage from the debris. A creature underneath the scaffolding must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 14 (4d6) bludgeoning damage from falling debris.<br /><br /><hr /><br />\n<h3>V4. Tower, First Floor</h3>\n<blockquote>The flagstone floor is strewn with debris, and a few old crates stand near the east wall. A torn curtain to the south partially obscures the tower vestibule.<br /><br />A five-foot-square indentation in the center of the floor contains four pulleys attached to taut iron chains that stretch up through a similarly sized hole in the rotted wooden ceiling. Standing next to the chains are four tall clay statues.</blockquote>\n<br />The four statues are <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"NTg3Yjc1MmNhZTI4\">clay golems</a></strong> that defend themselves if attacked (<strong>Foundry VTT </strong><strong>note:</strong> for map sizing purposes, the clay golem tokens here have been reduced to 5 feet. If they do come into play, treat them as a large creature as per their stat block). Otherwise, their sole purpose is to operate the elevator, which they do by pulling on the chains. The chains attach to a 5-foot-square wooden platform that normally rests on the fourth floor.<br /><br />If it appears that a creature wants to use the elevator, the golems lower the platform, then raise it to whichever level the creature specifies. They also heed commands issued from above. They obey only commands having to do with raising and lowering the elevator.<br /><br />The elevator isn&rsquo;t a smooth ride. The platform rises or lowers 5 feet per round, and its movements are jerky. If even one clay golem is destroyed, the remaining golems can no longer operate the elevator and remain motionless until attacked.<br /><br /><strong>WORLD BUILDER NOTE:</strong> there are currently no way to teleport players from a level to another with Multilevel token.<br />you can use the follwing tricks : drag all the character to another level or copy and paste them to the level they ask to reach.<br /><br />The crates in this room are all empty.<br /><br /><hr /><br />\n<h3>V5. Tower, Second Floor</h3>\n<blockquote>Dust and cobwebs fill this otherwise empty room, the wooden floor of which is badly rotted and partially collapsed.</blockquote>\n<br />In the middle of the room is a 5-foot-square hole in the floor and ceiling, with a rusty chain near each corner. The chains are part of the tower&rsquo;s elevator mechanism (see area V4). The 5-foot-square sections of floor that surround the central shaft are weak. Each 5-foot section can support 150 pounds; any more weight causes the section to collapse, and any creatures standing on that section fall 20 feet to the ground floor.<br /><br /><hr /><br />\n<h3>V6. Tower, Third Floor</h3>\n<blockquote>Time and the elements have all but destroyed this chamber, leaving a gash in the northwest wall and slimy black mildew on the walls. The wooden floor is completely rotted and has begun to fall away in places.</blockquote>\n<br />In the middle of the room is a 5-foot-square hole in the floor and ceiling, with a rusty chain near each corner. The chains are part of the tower&rsquo;s elevator mechanism (see area V4). The 5-foot-square sections of floor that surround the central shaft are weak. Each 5-foot section can support 50 pounds; any more weight causes the section to collapse, and any creatures standing on that section fall 40 feet to the ground floor, smashing through the second floor on the way down.<br /><br /><hr /><br />\n<h3>V7. Tower, Fourth Floor</h3>\n<blockquote>Unlike the levels below, this room shows signs of recent habitation, and although the place reeks of mold and mildew, it has plenty of creature comforts, including a cozy bed, a desk with matching chair, bright tapestries, and a large iron stove with plenty of wood to feed it. Light enters through arrow slits as well as through dirt-caked windows with broken shutters. Other features of the room include a standing suit of armor and a wooden chest. Old wooden rafters bend under the weight of the tower roof, which has somehow remained intact. Mounted to the rafters are pulleys around which hang iron chains that support the tower&rsquo;s elevator platform.</blockquote>\n<br />Van Richten spent several months in this room, reviewing a lifetime&rsquo;s worth of research on Strahd von Zarovich&mdash;notes that, once he committed them to memory, he burned in the stove. He also burned his journals. Ezmerelda searched the room, hoping to find a clue to her mentor&rsquo;s plan or whereabouts. Among the things she found here was a rolled-up map of Barovia and a burned page from van Richten&rsquo;s journal, which she took and hid in her wagon (area V1).<br /><br />The standing armor is a suit of <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"MGNmMDcyMjFhMTVh\">animated armor</a></strong>. It is incapacitated until someone speaks the command word (&ldquo;Khazan&rdquo;) within 10 feet of it, whereupon the armor follows the commands of the one who activated it. If 24 hours pass without its receiving a new instruction from its controller, the animated armor becomes incapacitated until someone reactivates it. If it is reduced to 0 hit points, the armor falls to pieces and is destroyed.<br /><br />A lavender aroma emanates from the wooden chest, which is unlocked and safe to open. It contains the severed head of a human Vistana named Yan. Its flesh has a waxy complexion and has been embalmed with magic oils. If a <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"ZDNhMzU2YjFhNzBk\">speak with dead</a> </em>spell is cast on his head (which would need to be taken somewhere away from the tower&rsquo;s spell drain effect), Yan reveals that he was banished from his clan for stealing. A half-elf bard named Rictavio offered Yan a ride in his carnival wagon. The two traveled together for several days, but their time together was tense. When it was clear that Rictavio was looking for a road to Barovia, Yan tried to steal the wagon as well as Rictavio&rsquo;s pet monkey, but Rictavio got the better of him and drove a sword through his gullet.<br /><br />The magic oils preserving Yan&rsquo;s head allow it to remember conversations it has while under the effect of <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"ZDNhMzU2YjFhNzBk\">speak with dead</a></em>. Rictavio has cast <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"ZDNhMzU2YjFhNzBk\">speak with dead</a></em> on the head twice to ask questions about the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"NzAzZjc4MGFjNWZk\">Vistani</a> of Barovia. Yan believes that the half-elf plans to cause great harm to the Vistani and begs the characters to warn his people. He doesn&rsquo;t know where his body is.<br /><br />\n<h4><span style=\"color: #632423;\">Fortunes of Ravenloft</span></h4>\nIf your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it&rsquo;s in a narrow compartment hidden in the wall behind the suit of armor. If the armor is activated and commanded to retrieve the treasure, it pulls the stones out of the wall, revealing the treasure beyond.<br /><br />If the characters have collapsed the tower (see area V2), they find the treasure after 1d8 + 2 hours of searching through the rubble. For each hour they spend searching, they have a 10 percent chance of accidentally unearthing a <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"NTg3Yjc1MmNhZTI4\">clay golem</a></strong> (see area V4) that withstood the collapse. The golem, which took no damage from the collapsing tower, is berserk and attacks until destroyed.</section>","img":"modules/cor-cos/journal/011_-_Chapter_11_3A_Van_Richten_27s_Tower/002_-_Van_Richten_27s_Tower/avatar.webp"}

Marina bore a striking resemblance to Strahd’s beloved Tatyana, both in appearance and manner, and she became Strahd’s obsession. He seduced her in the dead of night and feasted on her blood, but before she could be turned into a vampire, the burgomaster of Berez, Lazlo Ulrich, with the aid of a local priest named Brother Grigor, killed Marina to save her soul from damnation.

Check for a random encounter after every 30 minutes that the adventurers spend on the roads or in the wilderness (don’t check if they have already had two random encounters outdoors in the past 12 hours):<br><br><ul><li>If the characters are on a road, an encounter occurs on a roll of 18 or higher on a d20.</li><li>If the characters are in the wilderness, an encounter occurs on a roll of 15 or higher on a d20.</li></ul><br>If an encounter occurs, roll on the daytime or the nighttime encounter table, depending on the time, or have Strahd’s spies appear (see the “Strahd’s Spies” section below).<br><br><h3>Strahd’s Spies</h3>As the undisputed master of Barovia, Strahd has many spies, from swarms of bats to wandering Vistani, who report to him at dawn and dusk each day. These agents constantly patrol the land of Barovia and report everything they see to him.<br><br>Every day and night that the characters remain in Barovia, one or more of the vampire’s spies check on them and attempt to return to Strahd with a report. When a spy appears, characters who have a passive Wisdom (Perception) score equal to or greater than the spy’s Dexterity (Stealth) check notice it. A spy does not constitute an encounter if the characters are unaware of its presence. If they do notice it, the spy’s goal is usually escape, not combat. A secondary goal for a spy might be to acquire some physical object—a possession, an article of clothing, or even some part of a character’s body such as a lock of hair—that Strahd can use to improve the efficacy of his <em>scrying</em> spell. If one of Strahd’s spies is confronted by the party, the spy attempts to grab some accessible item from a character before fleeing. If Strahd acquires such an item, he uses his <em>scrying</em> spell to learn as much as he can about the party before planning his next attack, and to verify what his spies have already told him.<br><br><h3>Daytime Random Encounters in Barovia</h3><br><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>d12 + d8</strong></td><td><strong>Encounter</strong></td></tr><tr><td>2<br></td><td>3d6 <strong></strong><a

They carry torches and pitchforks.</blockquote><br>If the characters are moving quietly and not carrying light sources, they can try to hide from these <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NDM2ZTc2NDNmODQw ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Barovians</a>, who carry pitchforks (+2 to hit) instead of clubs, dealing 3 (1d6) piercing damage on a hit.<br><br><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NGRmMGRkZWIyOTZk ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Barovian </a><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OWYxMjNkNjFkMTdj ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>commoners</a> rarely leave their settlements. This group might be a family looking for a safer place to live, or an angry mob searching for the characters or heading toward Castle Ravenloft to confront Strahd.<br><hr><br><h3>Barovian Scouts</h3>If at least one character has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 16 or higher, read:<br><br><blockquote>You see a dark figure crouched low and perfectly still, aiming a crossbow in your direction.</blockquote><br>If more than one scout is present, the others are spread out over a 100-foot-square area.<br><br>These <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YTAwYWJmZmMwNGNm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Barovian scouts</a> are Barovian hunters or trappers searching for a missing villager or townsperson. Once they realize the characters aren’t out to kill them, they lower their weapons and request help in finding their missing person. If the characters decline, the scouts point them in the direction of the nearest settlement and depart without so much as a farewell. They wield light crossbows (+4 to hit, range 80/320 ft.) instead of longbows, dealing 6 (1d8 + 2) piercing damage on a hit.<br><hr><br><h3>Berserkers</h3>These wild mountain folk are covered head to toe in thick gray mud, which makes them hard to see in the fog and well hidden in the mountains they call home. While so camouflaged, they have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide. Characters whose passive Wisdom (Perception) scores are higher than the berserker’s Dexterity (Stealth) check can spot the nearest berserker.<br><br>If someone spots the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OTAwYTNkNjI5MzZm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>berserker</a>, read:<br><br><blockquote>You startle a wild-looking figure caked in gray mud and clutching a crude stone axe. Whether it’s a man or a woman, you can’t tell.</blockquote><br>The berserkers shun civilized folk. They try to remain hidden and withdraw if they are spotted, attacking only if trapped or threatened.<br><hr><br><h3>Corpse</h3>This encounter occurs only if the characters are traveling; otherwise, treat the result as no encounter.<br><br><blockquote>You find a corpse.</blockquote><br>Roll a d6 to determine the nature of the corpse:<br><br><strong>1–2.</strong> The corpse belonged to a wolf killed by spears and crossbow bolts.<br><strong>3–5.</strong> The corpse belongs to a Barovian man, woman, or child who was clearly torn to pieces by <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=Y2U1NjM4N2M0ZDgw ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>dire wolves</a>. If the party is accompanied by <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YTAwYWJmZmMwNGNm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Barovian scouts</a> (see above), the scouts recognize the corpse as the person they were searching for.<br><strong>6.</strong> The corpse looks like one of the characters (determined randomly) but has been stripped of armor, weapons, and valuables. If moved, its flesh melts away until only the skeleton remains.<br><hr><h3>Dire Wolves</h3><blockquote>A snarling wolf the size of a grizzly bear steps out of the fog.</blockquote><br>The area is lightly obscured by fog. If more than one dire wolf is present, the others aren’t far behind and can be seen as dark shadows in the fog. The <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=Y2U1NjM4N2M0ZDgw ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>dire </a><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MWM2Nzc5NjRiZTQy ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>wolves</a> of Barovia are cruel, overgrown wolves and Strahd’s loyal servants. They can’t be charmed or frightened.<br><hr><br><h3>Druid and Twig Blights</h3><blockquote>A gaunt figure with wild hair and bare feet bounds toward you on all fours, wearing a tattered gown of stitched animal skins. You can’t tell whether it’s a man or a woman. It stops, sniffs the air, and laughs like a lunatic. The ground nearby is crawling with tiny twig monsters.</blockquote><br>The Barovian wilderness is home to <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YTdmMjgwYzBiMTA2 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>druids</a> who worship Strahd because of his ability to control the weather and the beasts of Barovia. The druids are savage and violent, and each controls a host of <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=Y2ZjZGVkNzE0MzQ5 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>twig blights</a>, which fights until destroyed. If all the twig blights are destroyed or the druid loses more than half of its hit points, the druid flees, heading toward <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZWI2YTFiNTM4ZWFk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Yester Hill</a> (area Y).<br><hr><br><h3>False Trail</h3>This encounter occurs only if the characters are traveling; otherwise, treat the result as no encounter.<br><br><blockquote>You discover a foot trail that cuts through the wilderness.</blockquote><br>Evil <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YTdmMjgwYzBiMTA2 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>druids</a> left this trail. Following it in either direction leads to a spiked pit (see the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MzAyZjkwYjE3ODU2 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Pits</a> handout). A thin tarp made of twigs and pine needles conceals the pit, the bottom of which is lined with sharpened wooden stakes.<br><hr><br><h3>Ghost</h3><blockquote>A baleful apparition appears before you, its hollow eyes dark with anger.</blockquote><br>Many ghosts haunt this land. This particular <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZjE4ZDk1Y2JmOGY2 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>ghost</a> is all that remains of a person drained of life by Strahd (decide whether it’s a man or a woman). It appears and hisses, “No one will ever know you died here.” It then attacks. If the ghost succeeds in possessing a character, it leads its host to the gates of Ravenloft (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NTZhOGQwMTVjZmM4 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area J</a>) and hurls the host’s body into the chasm.<br><hr><br><h3>Grave</h3>This encounter occurs only if the characters are traveling; otherwise, treat the result as no encounter.<br><br><blockquote>You stumble upon an old grave.</blockquote><br>There is a 25 percent chance that the grave is intact, appearing as an elongated earthen mound or a rocky cairn. Characters who dig up the grave find the skeletal remains of a human clad in rusted chain mail (a soldier). Among the bones lie corroded weapons.<br><br>If the grave isn’t intact, it has been violated. The characters find a shallow, mud-filled hole with dirt or rocks strewn around it and a few scattered bones within.<br><hr><br><h3>Hidden Bundle</h3>This encounter occurs only if the characters are traveling; otherwise, treat the result as no encounter.<br><br>The characters find a leather-wrapped bundle hidden in the underbrush, stuffed inside a hollow log, or nestled in the boughs of a tree. If they open the bundle, read:<br><br><blockquote>The bundle contains one set of common clothes sized for a human adult.</blockquote><br>The clothes have a drab Barovian style to them. They belong to a wereraven or werewolf.<br><br><hr><br><h3>Hunting Trap</h3>This encounter occurs only if the characters are traveling; otherwise, treat the result as no encounter.<br><br>Have each of the characters in the front rank of the party’s marching order make a DC 15 Wisdom (Survival) check. If one or more of them succeeds, read:<br><br><blockquote>You spot a wolf trap, its steel jaws caked with rust. Someone has carefully hidden the trap under a thin layer of pine needles and detritus.</blockquote><br>Barovian hunters and trappers set these traps hoping to thin out the wolf population, but Strahd’s wolves are too clever to be caught in them. If none of the characters in the front rank spots the hidden trap, one random party member steps on it. Rules for the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZWZhYmQ1MjNiY2Rj ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>hunting trap</a> are presented in the handout. <br><hr><br><h3>Needle Blights</h3><blockquote>Hunched figures lurch through the mist, their gaunt bodies covered in needles.</blockquote><br>The woods crawl with <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=N2Q4MGZmNDkzYzMy ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>needle blights</a> that serve the evil <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YTdmMjgwYzBiMTA2 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>druids</a> of Barovia. If the characters are moving quietly and not carrying light sources, they can try to hide from these blights.<br><br><hr><br><h3>Revenant</h3><blockquote>A figure walks alone with the stride and bearing of one who knows no fear. Clad in rusty armor, it clutches a gleaming longsword in its pale hand and looks ready for a fight.</blockquote><br>From a distance, the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YjFkODEyZDQyYjAx ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>revenant</a> looks like a zombie and might be mistaken for such. A character within 30 feet of the revenant who succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (Insight) check can see the intelligence and hate in its sunken eyes. The revenant is clad in tattered chain mail that affords the same protection as leather armor.<br><br>The revenant was a knight of the Order of the Silver Dragon, which was annihilated defending the valley against Strahd’s armies more than four centuries ago. The revenant no longer remembers its name and wanders the land in search of Strahd’s wolves and other minions, slaying them on sight. If the characters attack it, the revenant assumes they are in league with Strahd and fights them until destroyed.<br><br>If the characters present themselves as enemies of Strahd, the revenant urges them to travel to <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=OGZkMWVkZjExOTc5 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Argynvostholt</a> (chapter 7) and convince <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YjkzZjg3MTA0Zjlh ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Vladimir Horngaard</a>, the leader of the Order of the Silver Dragon, to help them. The revenant would like nothing more than to kill Strahd, but it will not venture to Castle Ravenloft unless it receives orders to do so from Vladimir. If the characters ask the revenant to lead them to Horngaard in Argynvostholt, it does so while avoiding contact with Barovian settlements.<br><hr><br><h3>Scarecrows</h3>If at least one character has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 11 or higher, read:<br><br><blockquote>A scarecrow lurches into view. Its sackcloth eyes and rictus are ripe with malevolence, and its gut is stuffed with dead ravens. It has long, rusted knives for claws.</blockquote><br>If more than one scarecrow is present, the others are close by. If none of the characters has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 11 or higher, the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NTMwMDE1YjlkZGIy ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>scarecrows</a> catch the party by surprise.<br><br><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YjUxYzI2NDk0ZDIz ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Baba Lysaga</a> (see chapter 10, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NTkwZjliZmMwNGQ2 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area U3</a>) crafted these scarecrows to hunt down and kill ravens and were­ravens. The scarecrows are imbued with evil spirits and delight in murdering anyone they encounter.<br><hr><br><h3>Skeletal Rider</h3>Through the mist comes a skeletal warhorse and rider, both clad in ruined chainmail. The skeletal rider holds up a rusted lantern that sheds no light.<br><br>The human <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OGFjZjBlMWM5YWU0 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>skeleton</a></strong> and <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MmY5ZGM4NTUxNzY0 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>warhorse skeleton</a></strong> are all that remain of a rider and mount, both of whom perished trying to escape through the fog that surrounds Barovia. They are doomed to ride through the valley in search of another way out, without hope of salvation. The skeletons ignore the characters unless attacked.<br><br>If both the rider and its mount are destroyed, this encounter can’t occur again. The destruction of one skeleton doesn’t prevent future encounters with the other.<br><hr><br><h3>Strahd Zombies</h3><blockquote>Not even the cloying fog can hide the stench of death that descends upon you. Something evil approaches, its footsteps betrayed by snapping twigs.</blockquote><br>If the characters are moving quietly and not carrying light sources, they can try to hide from the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ODM2ODk3OGYwN2Nl ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Strahd Zombies</a>. These undead soldiers once served as guards in Castle Ravenloft. They fled the castle after Strahd became a vampire but couldn’t avoid their master’s wrath. They still wear bits of tattered livery, and they attack the living on sight.<br><hr><br><h3>Swarms of Bats</h3><blockquote>The stillness of the night is shattered by the shriek of bats and the flapping of tiny black wings.</blockquote><br>These <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NjVhZTI3NTMzNjMz ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>bats</a> are the servants of Strahd. They attack the characters without provocation.<br><hr><br><h3>Swarms of Ravens</h3><blockquote>Your presence in this dreary land has not gone unnoticed. A raven follows you for several minutes while keeping a respectful distance.</blockquote><br>The raven doesn’t caw or try to communicate with the characters. If they leave it alone, read:<br><br><blockquote>More ravens begin to take an interest in you. Before long, their numbers swell, and soon hundreds of them are watching you.</blockquote><br>The <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OGU4ZWY1YzMyYTNj ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>ravens</a> fly away if attacked. If they are left alone, they watch over the party, remaining with the characters until they reach Castle Ravenloft or a settlement. If the characters have a random encounter with hostile creatures, the raven swarms aid the characters by attacking and distracting their enemies.<br><hr><br><h3>Trinket</h3><blockquote>You find something on the ground.</blockquote><br>A random character finds a lost trinket. Roll on the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=OGZlMjA0MjI2ZDcy ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Trinkets</a> table, select a specific trinket from the table, or create one on the fly.<br><hr><br><h3>Vistani Bandits</h3><blockquote>You catch a whiff of pipe smoke in the cold air and hear laughter through the fog.</blockquote><br>These evil Vistani march through the Barovian wilderness without concern for their well-being, smoking pipes, drinking from wineskins, and telling ghost stories. They are searching for graves to plunder or hunting small game. For a price of 100 gp, they offer to serve as guides. As long as these Vistani are with the party, roll a d12 instead of a d12 + d8 when determining random encounters in the wilderness. In addition, wolves and dire wolves don’t threaten the characters as long as the Vistani are traveling with them and aren’t their prisoners.<br><br><strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> One <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OGYwMTAyODRiNTg3 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Vistani bandit</a> carries a pouch that holds 2d4 small gemstones (worth 50 gp each).<br><hr><br><h3>Wereraven</h3>This <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NzBhNmIwNTcxN2Y0 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>wereraven</a> in raven form watches the characters from a distance. Compare its Dexterity (Stealth) check result to the characters’ passive Wisdom (Perception) scores to see whether it remains hidden from the party.<br><br>If one or more characters spot the creature, read:<br><br><blockquote>Through the mist, you see a black bird circling overhead. When it feels your eyes upon it, the raven flies away, but it’s back before long, keeping its distance.</blockquote><br>The wereraven belongs to a secret order called the Keepers of the Feather. If the characters don’t spot it, the wereraven shadows them for 1d4 hours. At the end of that time, or anytime sooner if the characters attack it, the creature flies home to report what it has seen.<br><br>If the party has a second random encounter with a wereraven, this one presents itself to the characters as an ally and requests that they travel to the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=N2VhNzc0NDhlZmVi ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Blue Water Inn</a> in Vallaki to meet “some new friends.” It then flies off in the direction of the town.<br><hr><br><h3>Werewolves</h3>If the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=N2FhNWZiMTc5Yzdj ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>werewolves</a> are in human form, read:<br><br><blockquote>A deep voice calls out, “Who goes there?” Through the chill mist you see a large man in drab clothing wearing a tattered gray cloak. He has shaggy, black hair and thick muttonchops. He leans heavily on a spear and has a small bundle of animal pelts slung over his shoulder.</blockquote><br>If the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=N2FhNWZiMTc5Yzdj ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>werewolves</a> are in wolf form, read:<br><br><blockquote>You hear the howl of a wolf some distance away.</blockquote><br>How the werewolves act depends on the form they have taken.<br><br><strong><em>Human Form.</em></strong> Werewolves in human form pretend to be trappers. If more than one is present, the others are within whistling distance.<br><br>They try to befriend the characters to see if they are carrying silvered weapons. If the characters appear to have no such weapons, the werewolves assume hybrid form and attack. Otherwise, they part company with the characters and leave well enough alone.<br><br><strong><em>Wolf Form.</em></strong> Werewolves in wolf form follow the party from a safe distance for several hours. If their Dexterity (Stealth) checks exceed the characters’ passive Wisdom (Perception) scores, the werewolves attack with surprise when the characters decide to take a short or long rest. Otherwise, they wait until the characters are weakened by another random encounter before moving in for the easy kill.<br><br>The werewolves’ lair is a cave complex that overlooks Lake Baratok (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NDFhNjJjZDAyMGU3 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area Z</a>). If you used the “<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZTAzMWQwNmYxYWQz ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Werewolves in the Mist</a>” adventure hook to lure the characters to Barovia, captured werewolves can be forced to divulge the location of their den, where they keep their prisoners.<br><hr><br><h3>Will-o’-Wisp</h3>This random encounter occurs only once. If it comes up again, treat the result as no encounter.<br><br><blockquote>Several hundred yards away, through the fog, you see a flickering torchlight.</blockquote><br>If the characters follow the flickering light, read:<br><br><blockquote>The torchlight flutters as it moves away from you, but you never lose sight of it. You make your way quickly yet cautiously through the fog until you come upon the shell of a ruined tower. The upper floors of the structure have collapsed, leaving heaps of rubble and shattered timber around the tower’s base. The feeble light moves through an open doorway on the ground floor, then flickers and goes out.</blockquote><br>The light is a <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MWUwODU1MDY2ZDZi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>will-o’-wisp</a> that enters the ruined tower and becomes invisible, hoping to lure the characters inside to their doom.<br><br>The floor of the tower is made of packed earth. Its interior is <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=OTYzYWU0NjIyNmVh ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>desecrated ground</a>. Against the inside wall of the tower, across from the open doorway, is a closed, empty wooden chest.<br><br>If the characters disturb the chest, 3d6 <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=M2JhZmNmMzE0MDdj ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>zombies</a></strong> erupt from the earthen floor and attack. Once the zombies appear, the will-o’-wisp becomes visible and joins the fray.<br><hr><br><h3>Wolves</h3><blockquote>This land is home to many wolves, their howls at the moment too close for comfort.</blockquote><br>Characters have a few minutes to steel themselves before these <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MWM2Nzc5NjRiZTQy ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>wolves</a> attack. They heed the will of Strahd and can’t be charmed or frightened.<br><hr><br><h3>Zombies</h3><blockquote>The ungodly stench of rotting flesh hangs in the air. Up ahead, the walking, moaning corpses of dead men and women lumber about.</blockquote><br>These unfortunate Barovians fell prey to the evils of the land and now shamble from place to place as a ravenous mob.

If your campaign has a strong horror theme, you might want to use madness as a way to reinforce that theme, emphasizing the extraordinarily horrific nature of the threats the adventurers face.<br><br><h3>Going Mad</h3>Various magical effects can inflict madness on an otherwise stable mind. Certain spells, such as <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=OGI4ZTA3NWJmMTVh ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>contact other plane</a></em> and <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=NTI4NWVkYzRlN2M5 ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>symbol</a></em>, can cause insanity, and you can use the madness rules here instead of the spell effects in the <em>Player’s Handbook</em>. Diseases, poisons, and planar effects such as psychic wind or the howling winds of Pandemonium can all inflict madness. Some artifacts can also break the psyche of a character who uses or becomes attuned to them.<br><br>Resisting a madness-inducing effect usually requires a Wisdom or Charisma saving throw.<br><br><h3>Madness Effects</h3>Madness can be short-term, long-term, or indefinite. Most relatively mundane effects impose short-term madness, which lasts for just a few minutes.

These restrictions apply to magic items and artifacts that have properties that transport or banish creatures to other planes. Magic that allows transit to the Border Ethereal, such as the <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=MTJkOGZmMzhjODU5 ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>etherealness</a></em> spell and the Etherealness feature of incorporeal undead, is the exception to this rule.

Magic that summons creatures or objects from other planes functions normally in Barovia, as does magic that involves an extradimensional space.

In addition, spells that allow contact with beings from other planes function normally—with one proviso: Strahd can sense when someone in his domain is casting such a spell and can choose to make himself the spell’s recipient, so that he becomes the one who is contacted.<br><br><h3>Cosmetic Spell Modifications</h3>At your discretion, a spell can be modified cosmetically to enhance the horrific atmosphere.

Then shuffle the remaining cards (the common deck), keeping the two decks separate. Draw the top three cards from the common deck and lay them face down in the 1, 2, and 3 positions. Then draw the top two cards from the high deck and lay them face down in the 4 and 5 positions, as shown in the picture in this handout.<br /><br />Once all five cards are drawn and placed face down, follow the instructions below for each card in order.<br /><br />\n<h4>1.

Read the boxed text for the appropriate card, as given in the &ldquo;<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"YTUzZDZkZjY2NGQ5\">Treasure Locations</a>&rdquo; section that follows.<br /><br />\n<h4>4. Strahd&rsquo;s Enemy</h4>\nFlip over card 4, and read:<br /><br />\n<blockquote>This card sheds light on one who will help you greatly in the battle against darkness.</blockquote>\n<br />This card determines where the characters can find a powerful ally.

It also assumes you’re using the five player factions featured in the Adventurers League.<br><br><blockquote>“Werewolves in the mist!” You’ve heard these dreaded words spoken again and again by farmers, merchants, and adventurers alike. The hamlets east of Daggerford have fallen prey to a pack of werewolves that spills out of the Misty Forest on nights of the full moon, cloaked in crawling mist that seems to follow them wherever they go. The beasts spread death and mayhem, slaughtering adults and stealing children before retreating back into the woods. Others have tried to combat the werewolf menace, with little success.</blockquote><br>The Misty Forest lies thirty miles east of Daggerford. Before the characters embark on their quest, those who have faction allegiances receive additional information described in the sections that follow. Take the players aside, and read them the boxed text for their faction.<br><br><h3>Harpers</h3><blockquote>A Harper named Zelraun Roaringhorn knows a metal­smith who will silver your weapons for free. He also provides some helpful magic.<br><br>“We strive to protect the powerless,” he says. “If the children kidnapped by the werewolves are still alive, I would see them safely returned.”</blockquote><br>Zelraun Roaringhorn (LN male human <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZGMzMWQ5ZjYyMTNl ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>mage</a></strong>) has come to Daggerford to meet with its ruler, Duchess Morwen, and offer the Harpers’ support.<br><br>Zelraun gives each Harper character a <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MTE4ZDc2ZGNkMWQ3 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>spell scroll</a></em> of <em>remove curse</em>. He has also made arrangements with a metalsmith in Waterdeep to sheathe the characters’ weapons in silver. The party can have up to six weapons silvered in this manner. Twenty pieces of ammunition count as one weapon for this purpose.<br><br><strong><em>About the Harpers.</em></strong> The Harpers is a network of spellcasters and spies who advocate equality and who covertly oppose the abuse of power. The organization’s longevity is largely due to its decentralized, grassroots, secretive nature, and the autonomy of its members. The Harpers have small cells and lone operatives throughout the Forgotten Realms. They share information with one another from time to time as needs warrant. The Harpers’ ideology is noble, and its members pride themselves on their ingenuity and incorruptibility.<br><br><h3>Order of the Gauntlet</h3>You met with the heads of the Order of the Gauntlet chapter house in Waterdeep. They’ve stationed members of the order at various inns and homesteads east of Daggerford, so that locals need not fear the night. Now they’re counting on you to find the werewolves’ lair in the Misty Forest. Only then can the order mount an organized assault. As you prepare to depart, a knight of the order named Lanniver Strayl offers you his blessing.<br><br>Lanniver Strayl (LG male human <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=N2Q4ZmEyNDI4NGY0 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>knight</a></strong>), a devout follower of Tyr recently arrived in Daggerford, gives a <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZDMwNDM0MTc1N2Zi ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>potion of heroism</a></em> to each member of the order in the party.<br><br><strong><em>About the Order of the Gauntlet.</em></strong> Founded by paladins and clerics of Helm, Torm, and Tyr, the order is a dedicated group of like-minded individuals driven by religious zeal or a finely honed sense of justice and honor. The order is ready to lash out the moment evil acts, and not a moment before. The order strikes hard and fast, without waiting for the blessings of temples or the permission of rulers. The order believes that evil must be smashed, or it will swiftly overcome all.<br><br><h3>Emerald Enclave</h3><blockquote>You don’t need to consult with others in the Emerald Enclave to know that the werewolves are upsetting the natural order. For balance to be restored, they must be eradicated. It seems the gods of nature agree, for they’ve sent good weather and preserved the monsters’ tracks.</blockquote><br>Members of the Emerald Enclave in the party gain inspiration whenever the party kills a werewolf.<br><br><strong><em>About the Emerald Enclave.</em></strong> This widespread group of wilderness survivalists preserves the natural order while rooting out unnatural threats. Druids, rangers, and barbarians make up most of its membership.<br><br>Branches of the organization can be found wherever untamed wilderness exists. Members of the Emerald Enclave know how to survive, and more important, they want to help others do the same. They aren’t opposed to civilization or progress, but they strive to prevent civilization and the wilderness from destroying one another.<br><br><h3>Lords’ Alliance</h3><blockquote>A Lords’ Alliance operative from Waterdeep named Eravien Haund comes to Daggerford bearing news that alliance agents have not only captured one of the werewolves but also conducted a thorough interrogation before putting the creature out of its misery.</blockquote><br>Eravien Haund (LN male half-elf <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NTQ0NTQyYjBjN2Vl ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>noble</a></strong>) imparts the following information to fellow Lords’ Alliance members and tells them not to share it:<br><br><ul><li>The werewolf pack has almost a dozen members. The leader of the pack is a man named Kiril.</li><li>The werewolves come from a distant land called Barovia. The Lords’ Alliance has no information about it.</li><li>The werewolves worship a deity called Mother Night.</li><li>The werewolves leave and return to Barovia through some kind of ancient portal. (This is a deduction on Eravien’s part, based on the werewolf prisoner’s vague description of how the pack gets to and from Barovia.)</li></ul><br>Eravien believes that he can gain prestige within the Lords’ Alliance if he learns the whereabouts of the “ancient portal” that the werewolves are using and destroys it. He is convinced that the portal represents a danger not only to Daggerford but also to Waterdeep. Any Lords’ Alliance character who agrees to destroy it is given a <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MTE4ZDc2ZGNkMWQ3 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>spell scroll</a></em> of <em>magic weapon</em>. Eravien also promises to furnish the character with a <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NTU5MGVkMTg2MjVj ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>letter of recommendation</a> once the portal is destroyed.<br><br><strong><em>About the Lords’ Alliance.</em></strong> The Lords’ Alliance is a coalition of political powers concerned with their mutual security and prosperity. Heading the coalition are rulers in the North and along the Sword Coast.<br><br>Although alliance members have pledged to join forces against common threats, every lord in it places the fate and fortune of his or her settlement above all others. Agents of the alliance are chosen primarily for their loyalty, and are trained in observation, stealth, innuendo, and combat. Backed by the wealthy, they carry well-made equipment (often disguised to appear common). Alliance operatives are often glory hounds.<br><br><h3>Zhentarim</h3> <blockquote>The Black Network sees the werewolf menace as an opportunity to provide lords and nervous landowners with mercenaries to protect their holdings. But at least one of your fellow members has a grudge against the lycanthropes. Davra Jassur, a member of the Zhentarim based in Waterdeep, arranges a private meeting with you.</blockquote><br>Davra Jassur (LE female human <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YTJjZGMxYTVjNjA3 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>assassin</a></strong>) poses as a recruiter for the Black Network but is, in fact, a cutthroat who quietly disposes of competitors. Her husband, Yarak, was also a member of the Black Network. He was escorting a caravan traveling from Daggerford to the Way Inn (about sixty miles southeast of Daggerford, along the Trade Way) when the werewolves attacked. Yarak was slain, and Davra wants revenge; she wants the head of the werewolf pack leader. She is too tied up with “business” to engage in a personal vendetta, but if another member of the Black Network were to help, she would owe that individual a <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZDIwODRkZmVmZDAz ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>special favor</a>.<br><br><strong><em>About the Zhentarim.</em></strong> The Zhentarim is an unscrupulous shadow network that seeks to expand its influence throughout the Forgotten Realms. The public face of the Black Network appears relatively benign. It offers the best and cheapest goods and services, both legal and illicit, hoping to undercut its competitors.<br><br>Members of the Zhentarim think of themselves as members of an extended family and rely on it for resources and security. At the same time, members are granted the autonomy to increase their own wealth and influence. As a whole, the Zhentarim promises “the best for the best,” although in truth the organization is more interested in spreading its own propaganda and influence than investing in the improvement of its members.<br><br><h3>Welcome to Barovia</h3>Strahd is using the werewolves to lure adventurers to his domain. Characters can follow the werewolves’ tracks into the Misty Forest. After hours of fruitless searching, the characters are engulfed by thick fog:<br><br> <blockquote>The woods darken as the trees begin to close ranks, their needle-covered arms interlocking to blot out the sun. The shroud of mist that covers the ground turns into creeping walls of gray fog that silently envelop you until you can’t see more than a few feet in any direction. Soon, even the werewolf tracks disappear. </blockquote><br>No matter which direction they go, the characters come to a lonely dirt road that cuts through the woods, leading to area A (see <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NDFhNjJjZDAyMGU3 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>chapter 2</a>).

Guardian Vermin</h3><blockquote>A door of delicately engraved steel stands at the west end of this short, dark hallway. Intricate details stand out clearly on the door’s surface. The door seems to shine with a light of its own, untouched by time. Flanking the door are two alcoves in shadow. A dark, vaguely man-shaped figure stands in each alcove.</blockquote><br>The dark figures are four <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YjY1NjFlY2VkMjA1 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>swarms of rats</a></strong> piled atop one another to form manlike shapes (two swarms per alcove). These rats are under Strahd’s control and attack anyone that tries to move through this area.<br><br>The steel door is engraved with images of a human king in armor astride a horse, a majestic range of mountains and shooting stars in the background. Tiny figures of people and wolves frame the image.<br><br><hr><br><h3>K36. Dining Hall of the Count</h3><blockquote>Dust assaults your lungs. A sweet yet pungent smell of decay fills this room, in the center of which stands a long oak table. A blanket of dust covers the tabletop and its fine china and silverware. In the center of the table, a large, tiered cake leans heavily to one side. The once white frosting has turned green with age. Cobwebs hang like dusty lace down every side of the cake. A single doll figure of a well-dressed woman adorns the crest of the cake. Suspended above is a web-shrouded chandelier of forged iron. An arched window in the south wall is draped with heavy curtains. Resting in a wooden stand by the window is a dusty lute, and standing quietly in the southwest corner is a tall harp shrouded in cobwebs.</blockquote><br>The wedding cake is over four centuries old, kept in its current rotten state by the will of Strahd. The toy figure of the groom from the top of the cake was cast on the floor long ago. A character who searches the dusty floor finds the figurine with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check.<br><br>If the characters take the groom figurine out of the room, read the following if they return to the room at a later time:<br><br><blockquote>Billowing drapes draw your eye to the window, which has been broken outward. Scattered about the floor are chunks of the moldy cake, as if something had burst out of it.</blockquote><br>There are two explanations for the burst cake and broken window. Choose the one you think is creepier:<br><br><ul><li>Strahd smashes the cake and breaks the window to make the characters think something terrible has escaped and is now stalking them.</li><li>Strahd’s hate assumes a corporeal form, bursts out of the cake (the symbol of Sergei and Tatyana’s love), and escapes through the window. “Strahd’s hate” has the statistics of an <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MWUxMGQzY2NmNTFm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>invisible stalker</a></strong> and tries to kill whichever character is carrying the groom figurine.</li></ul><br>The room has wooden doors in the north and west walls, and an ornate steel door in the east wall (see <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZTM3NDAwZGFhNGE5 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K35</a> for details).<br><br>The harp stands 6½ feet tall, weighs close to 300 pounds, and is fashioned of dark, stained wood carved with images of harts and roses. Its taut strings are made of gut.<br><br>A character who plays the harp and succeeds on a DC 15 Charisma (Performance) check does well enough to summon the ghost of Pidlwick, a short little man dressed as a fool, with a tiny jingling bell at the end of his pointy dunce cap. He asks, “Why have you summoned me from beyond the grave?” Regardless of the answer, he commends the character for playing well and says, “In my crypt below the castle, thou shalt find a treasure worthy of one so talented as thee! May it help thee set this troubled place to rest.” If the characters think to ask him who he is, the fool replies, “Pidlwick.” If asked how he died, he replies humorlessly, “I fell down the stairs.” If <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OGI5MzY5ZWEzMmQ4 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Pidlwick II</a> (see <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=M2JjYzQ4NTk1NjM1 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K59</a>) is with the party, the ghost points at the clockwork effigy and says, “He pushed me down the stairs.”<br><br>With nothing more to add, the ghost of Pidlwick fades away and doesn’t appear again. If the characters attack the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZjE4ZDk1Y2JmOGY2 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>ghost</a>, it attacks them in turn.<br><br><h4>Treasure</h4>The lute, though old and covered in dust, has survived the passage of time. It is a magic <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NzRiODJmMmU5MmQ3 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>instrument of the bards</a></em> called a <em>Doss lute</em>.<br><br><hr><br><h3>K37. Study</h3><blockquote>A blazing hearth fire fills this room with rolling waves of red and amber light. The walls are lined with ancient books and tomes, their leather covers well oiled and preserved through careful use. All is in order here. The stone floor is concealed beneath a thick, luxurious rug. In the center of the room is a large, low table, waxed and polished to a mirrored finish. Even the poker in its stand next to the blazing fireplace is polished. Large, overstuffed divans and couches are arranged about the room. Two chairs of burgundy-colored wood with padded leather seats and back cushions face the hearth. A huge painting hangs over the mantelpiece in a heavy, gilded frame. The rolling firelight illuminates the carefully rendered portrait. It is an exact likeness of Ireena Kolyana.</blockquote> <br>This chamber has several exits, including a large set of double doors in the west wall, a door at each end of the north wall, and a door to the south.<br><br>The painting above the fireplace depicts Tatyana (see <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MDI3ODg0YjAyZTM4 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Handout: Tatyana</a>), a beautiful young woman with auburn hair. Strahd commissioned the painting over four centuries ago to impress his beloved. The fact that <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YjY2YzRmODJjYmNl ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Ireena Kolyana</a> looks exactly like Tatyana is proof to Strahd that both women were born with the same soul.<br><br>The back wall of the fireplace contains a secret door, which is opened by lifting the poker from its stand. The fire must be extinguished in order for anyone to reach the secret door safely. Otherwise, a creature that enters the fireplace for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there takes 5 (1d10) fire damage and catches fire. Until someone takes an action to douse the flames on the creature, it takes 5 (1d10) fire damage at the start of each of its turns. (This fire damage is cumulative with the damage from standing in the fireplace.)<br><br>The secret door provides access to <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZTM3NDAwZGFhNGE5 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K38</a>.<br><br><h4>Treasure</h4>The real treasure here is Strahd’s collection of books—over one thousand unique tomes in all. The collection is worth 80,000 gp.

False Treasury</h3><blockquote>Resting on the floor of this smoke-filled room is a closed chest surrounded by piles of gold, silver, and copper coins. The fittings and clawed feet on the chest are evidence of great workmanship.<br><br>Attached to the east wall are two torch sconces. The southernmost one holds a torch with an intricate metal base. The other is empty. A skeleton in broken plate armor lies against the wall. The skeleton’s right hand is on its throat, and its left hand holds the matching torch from the empty sconce. </blockquote><br>The coins scattered around the trapped chest total 50 gp, 100 sp, and 2,000 cp. The chest weighs 40 pounds and is unlocked. When opened, it releases a cloud of sleeping gas that fills the room. Any creature in the room must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 4 hours. If all the characters succumb to the gas, they are found by the witches who lair in <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=M2JjYzQ4NTk1NjM1 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K56</a> and dragged to <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=M2JjYzQ4NTk1NjM1 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K50</a>, then left there unharmed. If even one character resists the effect of the gas, the witches do not appear.<br><br>The armored skeleton on the floor is all that remains of an adventurer. His corpse has nothing of value.<br><br><h4>Secret Doors</h4>This room is concealed behind two secret doors.<br><br>The secret door to the west is set into the back wall of the fireplace (area K37) and can be pulled open from within this room by lifting a simple locking mechanism (which is connected to the poker in the study). It’s possible that a character might open this secret door inadvertently by lifting the poker in area K37. Characters can otherwise locate the secret door normally, but a successful check doesn’t reveal the mechanism to open it. That can be found only through trial and error, or the characters can bypass the mechanism with a <em>knock</em> spell or similar magic.<br><br>The secret door at the northern end of the east wall is sealed shut. If the torch is taken from the skeleton’s hand and placed back in the empty sconce, the secret door swings inward, revealing area K39 beyond. Removing the torch from its sconce at any time causes the secret door to close and lock shut, becoming sealed as before. Characters can locate this secret door normally, but a successful check doesn’t reveal the mechanism to open it. That can be found only through trial and error, or the characters can bypass the mechanism with a <em>knock</em> spell or similar magic.<br><br><hr><br><h3>K39. Hall of Webs</h3><blockquote>This ancient hall is choked with spider webs broken by a single clear path down its center.</blockquote><br>The hall has an arched ceiling 20 feet overhead, hidden behind thick webbing. At the eastern end are a pair of arched bronze doors of ornate design. These doors can be pulled open to reveal area K40 beyond.<br><br>Most of the hall is full of giant spider <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YTEwMTlhMWFhOTE3 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>webs</a>. Characters who stray from the unobstructed path through the webs risk becoming stuck.<br><br><h4>Secret Doors</h4>At the west end of the hall are two secret doors.<br><br>The secret door on the west wall can’t be opened from this side, except by magic (such as a <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=NzgzNWMwNDZlYzNh ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>knock</a></em> spell). See area K38 for more information on this secret door. If the characters pass through this door coming from area K38, it closes and locks behind them if they don’t take measures to prop it open.<br><br>A narrow secret door at the western end of the south wall is hidden behind a mass of webs. If these webs are cleared away, characters can search for the secret door, finding it with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. The door can be pulled open to reveal area K31b.<br><br><hr><br><h3>K40. Belfry</h3><blockquote>You can hear the rain and thunder outside, and the air here is cold and damp. Veils and curtains of webbing fill the room, making it hard to gauge its width and depth. A single, narrow path leads to the dark center of the room, where a rope dangles from high above.</blockquote><br>The rope is attached to a great bell mounted in a wooden framework 50 feet overhead. Pulling the rope or attempting to climb it brings forth a loud, long “GONG.” That sound causes five <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YzYzMzhjZmFkMjU4 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>giant spiders</a></strong> to drop from their webs and attack. The spiders attack only if they are attacked or if the bell is sounded.<br><br>Most of the belfry is filled with giant spider <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YTEwMTlhMWFhOTE3 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>webs</a>. Characters who blunder into them risk becoming stuck.<br><br>At the west end of the north wall, behind thick webs, is a secret door that opens into area K41.<br><br><hr><br><h3>K41. Treasury</h3><blockquote>This octagonal vault is free of dust and cobwebs. The domed ceiling forty feet above is painted black and sparkles with a display of stars in unfamiliar constellations. Barely contained within this vault is a square tower, twenty feet on a side and thirty feet high, with arrow slits on all sides and a battlemented roof.</blockquote><br>The domed ceiling is coated with dry pitch. The “stars” are shards of glowing crystal embedded in the pitch, each one as bright as a candle flame. Thanks to the starry “night sky,” the vault is dimly lit.<br><br>The plundered riches of Strahd’s secret hoard lie within this adamantine tower, which is actually a <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=M2RkNTZkODYyZmJh ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Daern’s instant fortress</a></em>. Only Strahd knows the command word to alter its shape and size, which can’t be done until every bit of treasure inside it is removed. Only Strahd can open the two means of entry: a sealed adamantine door set into the base of the tower on the north side, and an adamantine trapdoor on the roof.<br><br>The arrow slits of the tower are 4 inches wide and 2 feet tall, and the walls of the fortress are 3 inches thick. Characters who are able to reduce their size or assume gaseous form can enter the tower through these slits.<br><br><h4>Treasure</h4>The ground floor of the <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=M2RkNTZkODYyZmJh ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Daern’s instant fortress</a></em> contains 50,000 cp, 10,000 sp, 10,000 gp, 1,000 pp, 15 assorted gems (100 gp each), and a <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZGU4ZTlkMDJkMDhm ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>shield of the silver dragon</a></em>.<br><br>The upper floor of the tower contains 10 pieces of jewelry (250 gp each) in a red velvet sack, an <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZWMxOTkyNGZiZjg4 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>alchemy jug</a></em>, a <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=OGFiYjBlMzllYmEx ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>helm of brilliance</a></em>, a<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NDE1MDBjMjE5MmQw ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i><em>+1 rod of the pact keeper</em></a>, and an unlocked wooden coffer with four compartments, each one containing a <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NDBhYzNmNWNmZDNl ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>potion of greater healing</a></em>.<br><br><h4><span style=\"color: rgb( 99 , 36 , 35 )\">Fortunes of Ravenloft</span></h4>If your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it is lying atop the coins on the ground floor inside the tower.<br><br>If your card reading indicates an encounter with <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTZiYzA5N2ViNTZi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Strahd</a> in this area, he is perched atop the tower.<br><br><hr><br><h3>K42. King’s Bedchamber</h3><blockquote>Sweet smells waft from this delicately lit room. A great arched window along the west wall is covered by heavy red draperies, their golden tassels glinting in the light of three candelabras sitting atop small tables about the room. Tall white candles burn with bright, steady light.<br><br>A large bed, canopied by silk curtains, sits with its headboard against the north wall. Carved into the headboard with great skill is a large “Z.” Lying amid the velvet and satin sheets and bedclothes is a young woman in a nightgown. One of her dainty slippers has fallen to the floor at the bed’s foot.</blockquote><br>Arched double doors lead from this room to the south and east.<br><br>The window is divided into four tall panes of glass, each enclosed by a lead framework. The two outermost sections have small iron hinges built into them so that they can be opened, as well as iron latches to lock them in place when they’re closed. The window looks out onto the parapet (area K46).<br><br>The figure on the bed is <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OGZmNTAyNDdlNmZk ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Gertruda</a></strong>, the daughter of <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTA5MDk2ZmUzZjcx ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Mad Mary</a> (see chapter 3,<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YWZmNWU5OGQ4ZmJl ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i> area E3</a>). Gertruda is oblivious to any danger to herself—especially from Strahd, who has charmed her. Sheltered by her mother, she was never allowed to leave home as a child. She finally slipped away and made her way to the castle, drawn by its majesty.<br><br>Gertruda is innocent, and years spent as a shut-in have twisted her sense of reality. Consequently, she maintains a fairy-tale view of life. When faced with a decision, she almost always makes the most simplistic choice. She is naive to the point of being a danger to herself and others. Fortunately for her, Strahd has not yet bitten her, though he intends to. (If he can do so while the characters look on helplessly, so much the better.)<br><br>Next to the bed, set into the north wall, is a secret door. It can be pushed open to reveal a dusty hall that ends at a similar secret door in the back of an alcove (see area K45 for details). Gertruda doesn’t know that this secret door exists.<br><br><hr><br><h3>K43. Bath Chamber</h3><blockquote>Red satin curtains hang in archways at both ends of the south wall in this dark room. Between them, in the center of the chamber, stands a large, ornate iron tub with clawed feet. The tub is full of blood.</blockquote><br>Both curtained archways lead to area K44.<br><br><h4>Tormented Spirit</h4>The spirit of Varushka, a maid, haunts this chamber. She took her own life when Strahd began feeding on her, denying him the chance to turn her into a vampire spawn.<br><br>The blood in the tub isn’t real, but rather a manifestation of Varushka’s tormented spirit. If the blood is disturbed in any way, read:<br><br><blockquote>A blood-drenched creature explodes out of the tub and attaches to the ceiling, cackling maniacally. Blood pours off its pale flesh, bony limbs, and stringy hair as it scuttles away.</blockquote><br>The creature that erupts from the tub is no more real than the blood. It can’t be harmed and doesn’t attack. It scuttles across the ceiling, disappearing into area K44 through one of the archways. Once there, it disappears.<br><br><hr><br><h3>K44. Closet</h3><blockquote>The walls here are lined with iron hooks, upon which hang black capes and formal wear. Two arched windows in the south wall are covered by heavy curtains.</blockquote><br>Twenty-eight capes and sixteen sets of fine clothes are stored here. Red satin drapes hang in the archways that connect this closet to the adjoining bath chamber (area K43).<br><br><hr><br><h3>K45. Hall of Heroes</h3><blockquote>Dark alcoves line the walls of this long hall. The ceiling has fallen here, leaving rubble strewn across the floor. Overhead, the beams of Ravenloft’s roof are exposed. Lightning from the dark clouds above sporadically illuminates the hall, lighting the faces of life-sized human statues in the alcoves. Each visage is frozen in terror. </blockquote><br>The ten statues that line this corridor depict ancient heroes. In actuality, the faces of the statues are stoic and expressionless, but whenever the lightning flashes, their expressions change to utter horror until the hall goes dark again.<br><br>The statues are imbued with the spirits of Strahd’s ancestors, all of which grieve over the termination of their bloodline. Each spirit will answer one question if addressed directly. The spirits’ answers are always short and vague, and there is a 20 percent chance that a spirit’s answer is wrong.<br><br>The stairs at the west end of the hall descend 40 feet to <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=Yjc3NTVkZDRiZmEz ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K33</a>.

Parapets</h3><blockquote>You stand on a ten-foot-wide walkway that encircles most of the keep. The drizzle of rain continues, punctuated by the occasional clap of thunder or stroke of lightning. Far below these parapets are the shining wet cobblestones of the courtyard.</blockquote><br>The walkway runs around the front of the upper portion of the keep. Battlemented walkways extend from the keep north, south, and east to the outer walls of the castle as well. (See the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NTZhOGQwMTVjZmM4 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i></a><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NTZhOGQwMTVjZmM4 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Map 2: Walls of Ravenloft</a> map for the length and location of the castle walls.) All the windows leading from this area into the keep are shut and locked, but can easily be broken.<br><br>If the characters loiter on the parapets or atop the castle walls for more than 5 minutes, they encounter <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NDA1Y2E0YWViNWI5 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i><strong>Strahd’s animated armor</strong></a> making the rounds. It patrols the parapets and the outer walls of Ravenloft day and night. Under a darkened sky, characters without darkvision are more likely to hear the clatter of the armor approaching before they can see it.<br><br>The armor can’t be salvaged if it is reduced to 0 hit points.<br></section>","img":"modules/cor-cos/journal/004_-_Chapter_4_3A_Castle_Ravenloft/006_-_Map_5_3A_Rooms_of_Weeping/avatar.webp"}

(Some cards offer two possible results, A and B; in such a case, you can pick the one you prefer or that better suits the circumstances of the adventure.)<br><br>Strahd senses that this NPC is a danger to him and tries to eliminate the threat as quickly as possible.

For the one so designated, however, the information in this section regarding the NPC’s behavior takes precedence over whatever is said elsewhere in these pages; that NPC is extraordinary.<br><br><blockquote><strong>Artifact (Joker 1)<br></strong>Look for an entertaining man with a monkey.

If they speak to him about this possibility, Blinsky jokes that he and the monkey are “old friends,” but if the characters ask him to come with them to fight Strahd, he politely declines. If the characters tell him about the tarokka reading, Blinsky admits that he acquired the monkey from a half-elf carnival ringmaster named Rictavio.<br><br><hr><br><blockquote><strong>Beast (Jack of Diamonds)<br></strong>A werewolf holds a secret hatred for your enemy.

Although initially unwilling to accompany the characters, he will do so if the characters convince him that the honor of the Order of the Silver Dragon can be restored with his help. Doing this requires a successful DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check.<br><br><hr><br><blockquote><strong>B. Ghost (King of Hearts)<br></strong>Stir the spirit of the clumsy knight whose crypt lies deep within the castle.</blockquote><br>This card refers to Sir Klutz the phantom warrior (see chapter 4, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YzI0YTFjYTVjY2Jh ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K84, crypt 33</a>).

If the characters cast a <em>raise dead</em> spell or a <em>resurrection</em> spell on his preserved corpse, Nikolai (LN male human <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NTQ0NTQyYjBjN2Vl ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>noble</a></strong>) agrees to help the characters once he feels well enough, despite his wife’s protests. Although his family has long supported Strahd, Nikolai came to realize toward the end of his life that Strahd must be destroyed to save Barovia.<br><br>If the characters don’t have the means to raise Nikolai from the dead, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MTY5MmZlODgzNzJi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Rictavio</a> gives them a <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MTE4ZDc2ZGNkMWQ3 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>spell scroll</a></em> of <em>raise dead</em> if he learns of their need.

Horseman (Joker 2)<br></strong>A man of death named Arrigal will forsake his dark lord to serve your cause. Beware! He has a rotten soul.</blockquote><br>This card refers to the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NzAzZjc4MGFjNWZk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Vistani</a> assassin <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OTExMDZkOWQ1MzRh ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Arrigal</a> (see chapter 5, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ODllODk5YTg3YTEx ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area N9c</a>). If the characters mention this card reading to him, he accepts his fate and accompanies them. If the characters succeed in defeating Strahd, Arrigal betrays and attacks them, believing that he is destined to become Barovia’s new lord.<br><br><hr><br><blockquote><strong>A. Innocent (Queen of Hearts)</strong><br>I see a young man with a kind heart. A mother’s boy! He is strong in body but weak of mind. Seek him out in the village of Barovia.</blockquote><br>This card refers to <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MTc5ZTRmZGFjZmJk ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Parriwimple</a> (see chapter 3, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YWZmNWU5OGQ4ZmJl ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area E1</a>). Although he’s a simpleton, he won’t travel to Castle Ravenloft without good cause. Characters can manipulate him into going by preying on his good heart. For instance, he might go there to help rescue missing Barovians, or to save the life of <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YjY2YzRmODJjYmNl ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Ireena Kolyana</a>, who is very beautiful. The characters must somehow deal with Bildrath, Parriwimple’s employer, who won’t let the foolish boy go to the castle for any reason.<br><br><hr><br><blockquote><strong>B. Innocent (Queen of Hearts)<br></strong>Evil’s bride is the one you seek! </blockquote><br>This card refers to <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YjY2YzRmODJjYmNl ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Ireena Kolyana</a> (see chapter 3, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YWZmNWU5OGQ4ZmJl ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area E4</a>). Her brother, Ismark, opposes the idea of Ireena’s being taken to Castle Ravenloft, but she insists on going there once the characters tell her about the card reading. Ireena won’t accompany the characters, however, until Kolyan Indirovich’s body is laid to rest in the cemetery.<br><br><hr><br><blockquote><strong>A. Marionette (Jack of Hearts)<br></strong>What horror is this? I see a man made by a man. Ageless and alone, it haunts the towers of the castle. </blockquote><br>This card refers to <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OGI5MzY5ZWEzMmQ4 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Pidlwick II</a> (see chapter 4, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=M2JjYzQ4NTk1NjM1 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K59</a>).<br><br><hr><br><blockquote><strong>B.

Clovin serves the Abbot out of fear and a perverse sense of loyalty. His job is to deliver food to the other mongrelfolk, whom he abhors. If the Abbot still lives, Clovin doesn’t want to earn his master’s ire by attempting to leave, and he refuses to accompany the characters. But if the Abbot dies, Clovin doesn’t have any reason to remain in the abbey, so he’s willing to come along if he is bribed with wine. Clovin provides no benefit to the party without his viol.<br><br><hr><br><blockquote><strong>Mists (Queen of Spades)<br></strong>A Vistana wanders this land alone, searching for her mentor. She does not stay in one place for long.

The old wereraven, realizing that he has a chance to end Strahd’s tyranny, leaves his vineyard and winery in the capable hands of his sons, Adrian and Elvir. But before he travels to Castle Ravenloft to face Strahd, Davian insists on reconciling with his third son, Urwin Martikov (see chapter 5, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=N2VhNzc0NDhlZmVi ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area N2</a>).<br><br><hr><br><blockquote><strong>A.

Fermentation Vats</h3><blockquote>The rich smell of fermenting wine fills this large, two-story chamber, which is dominated by four enormous wooden casks, each one eight feet wide and twelve feet tall. A wooden staircase in the center of the room climbs to a ten-foot-high wooden balcony that clings to the south wall, which has four windows set into it at balcony level. Stacked against the wall underneath the balcony are old, empty barrels with “The Wizard of Wines” burned into their sides. The balcony climbs another five feet as it continues along the west and east walls, ending at doors leading to the winery’s upper level. Underneath these side balconies are several doors, some of which hang open. Beneath the sloping roof stretch thick rafters, upon which scores of ravens have quietly gathered. They watch you with great interest.</blockquote><br>Four <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OGU4ZWY1YzMyYTNj ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>swarms of ravens</a></strong> perch on the rafters but don’t attack the characters under any circumstances.<br><br>Unless they have been drawn outside, twenty-four <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=Y2ZjZGVkNzE0MzQ5 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i><strong>twig blights</strong></a><strong> </strong>and one <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YTdmMjgwYzBiMTA2 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>druid</a></strong> (NE female human) are also present. If they are here, read:<br><br><blockquote>The balcony creaks, drawing your eye to a wild-looking figure hunched over the westernmost cask, pouring a flask of thick syrup into it. She wears a gown made of animal skins and a headdress with goat horns, and her hair is long and unkempt. Suddenly, you see something skittering across the floor. It looks like a tiny creature made of twigs. It moves from its hiding place under the stairs and disappears behind the easternmost cask.</blockquote><br>The four containers are fermentation vats, where grape juice is mixed with other ingredients and turned into wine. The easternmost cask has split in the back, creating a 6-inch-wide, 6-foot-high opening through which the twig blights can pass. All twenty-four twig blights are hidden in the cask, ready to emerge and attack when commanded to do so. While inside the cask, they have total cover against attacks that originate outside the cask.<br><br>The druid is poisoning the fermentation vats. The three westernmost vats contain poisoned wine, enough to fill a total of twenty barrels. Drinking the poisoned wine has the same effect as drinking a <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZDlkZDZlZjIyYWIx ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>potion of poison</a></em>. Pouring antitoxin into a vat neutralizes the poison, but it also spoils the taste of the wine. Casting a <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=MGUzMGIwZDk4ZDhk ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>purify food and drink</a></em> spell on a vat neutralizes the poison without spoiling the wine.<br><br>In addition to her animal skin gown and horned headdress, the druid wears necklaces of human teeth. If the characters attack the druid, she calls forth her twig blights. When that happens, the swarms of ravens descend from the rafters and begin attacking the blights. Each swarm tears apart one twig blight on each of its turns.<br><br>The sliding wooden doors along the north wall (leading to area W5) are chained shut from the inside. The key to the padlock can be found in the office (area W20).<br><br>The single door leading to area W5 is barred shut from the inside, as is the single door leading to area W2.<br><br><hr><br><h3>W10. Glassblower’s Workshop</h3><blockquote>A dirty window in the south wall allows dim light to enter this room. Wine bottles are manufactured here, as evidenced by the tools lying about, the wooden rack full of freshly blown glass bottles along the south wall, the hearth built into the southwest corner, and the barrel of sand standing next to it. A staircase descends underground, and between it and the rack of bottles stands a barred door.</blockquote><br>The stairs lead down to area W13. The bottles stored in the rack don’t have labels. The east door is barred from the inside.<br><br><h4><span style=\"color: rgb( 99 , 36 , 35 )\">Fortunes of Ravenloft</span></h4><div>If your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it’s buried in the barrel of sand. Emptying the barrel or digging through the sand reveals the treasure without the need for a check.<br><br></div><hr><br><h3>W11. Spiral Staircase</h3><blockquote>This turret contains a stone spiral staircase. Windows in the outer wall allow light to enter.</blockquote><br>The stairs connect all three levels of the winery.<br><br><hr><br><h3>W12. Ramp</h3><blockquote>This turret has a sloping, wooden floor that spirals from the cellar to the upper levels. Scratch marks suggest that barrels are rolled up and down the ramp on a routine basis.</blockquote><br>The spiraling ramp connects all three levels of the winery. The evil druids who have taken over the winery use this ramp to move between levels.<br><br><hr><br><h3>W13. Back Staircase</h3><blockquote>Thick moss covers the walls of this underground staircase. At the foot of the steps is a landing with an arched wooden door set into the north wall.</blockquote><br>This staircase connects areas W10 and W14.<br><br><hr><br><h3>W14. Wine Cellar</h3>In the winery’s heyday, the wine cellar was packed with barrels awaiting shipment, but those days are long gone.<br><br><blockquote>Wooden pillars and beams support the ten-foot-high ceiling of this ice-cold cellar, which is split in two by a five-foot-thick brick wall. A thin mist covers the floor. Each half of the cellar features an eight-foot tall wooden partition that doubles as a wine rack. The western rack stands empty, but the eastern one is half filled with wine bottles.</blockquote><br>Area 14 includes Area 14a. for the western wing and 14b. for the eastern wing.<br><br>Unless they have been drawn outside, five <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=N2Q4MGZmNDkzYzMy ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>needle blights</a></strong> and one <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YTdmMjgwYzBiMTA2 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>druid</a></strong> (NE male human) lurk in the eastern portion (area 14b) of the cellar. If they are here when the characters enter that part of the cellar, read:<br><br><blockquote>Something moves behind the eastern wine rack. Through the holes, you glimpse a half dozen humanoid figures, one with a full rack of antlers. You hear a gravelly voice mutter the words of a spell.</blockquote><br>On his first turn, from behind the wine rack, the druid casts a <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=NjU1OWJlNzdiYjdh ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>thunderwave</a></em> spell, which shatters 1d20 + 10 of the wine bottles as it resounds throughout the cellar. The druid then orders the needle blights to attack.<br><br>The cellar gets markedly colder the closer one gets to the north wall. Against that wall in the eastern portion of the cellar (area 14b) rest three frosty barrels containing Purple Grapemash No. 3, a fact that is emblazoned on each barrel’s side. A single bottle of Purple Grapemash No. 3 lies on the flagstone floor in the western half of the cellar (area 14a).<br><br>The wine rack in the eastern half of the cellar (area 14b) holds forty bottles, the labels of which show that the wine is the winery’s Red Dragon Crush.<br><br>A secret door between the two halves of the wine cellar can be pushed open to reveal a freezing cold passageway (area W15).<br><br><hr><br><h3>W15. Brown Mold</h3>If the characters open the secret door, read:<br><br><blockquote>It takes some effort to push open the secret door, and you are greeted by a blast of cold air. A dark tunnel stretches for fifteen feet, ending at an archway beyond which lies a shallow cave.<br></blockquote><br>Characters who have a light source can see brown mold covering the walls, floor, and ceiling around the archway and the cave beyond. Growing throughout this area, keeping the wine cellar cool, are ten patches of <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NDg2OWJiMzg2ZWEx ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>brown mold</a>. The characters are safe from the mold as long as they keep their distance.<br><br><hr><br><h3>W16. Loading Winch</h3><blockquote>This room has a wooden floor with a ten-foot-square hole cut into the middle of it. Looming over the hole is a wooden winch. Perched atop it is a man with wild hair, rotted teeth, and skin painted red with blood. He waves a gnarled staff made from a black branch and babbles at you.</blockquote><br>The man is a <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YTdmMjgwYzBiMTA2 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>druid</a></strong> (NE male human) who fights only if cornered. Otherwise, he tries to flee by dropping onto the wagon in the loading dock (area W2). He then looks for a place in the winery to hide. A character who understands Druidic can translate the his words: “Nature bows to my every whim, for I have the vampire’s staff!”<br><br>A secret door in the north corner of the west wall can be pulled open to reveal a bedroom (area W17).<br><br><h4>Treasure</h4>The druid wields a <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZDI0ODk0ODRjOTEz ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Gulthias staff</a></em>, which can be used to destroy the blights in the winery.<br><hr><br><h3>W17. Master Bedroom</h3>This bedroom normally belongs to <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=Mzg3YWU3MzQ3MjRm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Davian Martikov</a> but is currently being used by his daughter, Stefania, and son-in-law, Dag, while they raise their baby daughter.<br><br><blockquote>This room contains a four-poster bed, its headboard carved in the likeness of a giant raven. A soft black rug covers the floor between the bed and the door. In the corners of the south wall stand two slender wardrobes with a tapestry of a church hanging on the wall between them. Beneath the tapestry sits a handsomely carved rocking cradle. To the north, under a window, is a plain desk and chair. Other furnishings include a wooden chest and a freestanding mirror in a wooden frame.</blockquote><br>One of the wardrobes contains Stefania’s clothes, and the other contains Dag’s. The desk holds manifests recording wine shipments for the past century. A cursory examination of recent records reveals that almost all shipments are made to the following locations:<br><br><ul><li>“BV” (the Blood o’ the Vine tavern in the village of Barovia)</li><li>“BW” (the Blue Water Inn in the town of Vallaki)</li><li>“K” (Krezk)</li><li>“VISTANI”</li></ul><br>Characters who check the oldest records also find entries for “S” (Strahd).<br><br>The wooden chest is locked, and the key is hidden in a compartment in one of the bedposts. A character who searches the bed notices that a knob on one of the bedposts is loose and can be removed, revealing the compartment inside.<br><br>The contents of the chest are described in the “Treasure” section below.<br><br>A secret door in the north corner of the east wall can be pushed open to gain access to the loading winch (area W16).<br><br><h4>Treasure</h4>Inside the chest are 50 gp, 270 ep (each electrum coin stamped with the profiled visage of Strahd von Zarovich), and 350 sp. A secret compartment in the lid can be found with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. It holds a gold locket (worth 25 gp) containing a painted portrait of a beautiful woman (Davian’s deceased wife, Angelika), as well as a pouch containing five 50 gp gemstones.<br><br><hr><br><h3>W18. Kitchen and Dining Room</h3><blockquote>This room contains a rectangular table surrounded by eight chairs, an L-shaped cupboard, and a floor-to-ceiling closet pantry. Next to the pantry is a small iron stove.</blockquote><br>The cupboard holds dishware and eating utensils. The pantry holds cooking ingredients and the winery’s stores.<br><hr><br><h3>W19. Sleeping Quarters</h3><blockquote>Two pairs of bunk beds occupy this room. Against the west wall rest four identical footlockers.</blockquote><br>Davian, Adrian, and Elvir sleep in the westernmost room. Claudiu and his two younger brothers sleep in the easternmost room, where a few toys are scattered about. One of the toys seems to resemble a child’s wooden rocking horse, except that the horse is black with wild eyes and has painted orange flames where its mane, tail, and hooves should be. Carved into the wooden nightmare is the name “<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ODExZjZlNDdhN2Mw ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Beucephalus</a>” and, in smaller lettering, the slogan “Is No Fun, Is No Blinsky!”<br><br>The footlockers contain clothing and personal belongings, but nothing of value.<br><br><hr><br><h3>W20. Printing Press</h3>The door to this room hangs open.<br><br><blockquote>In this chamber are a desk, a chair, a tall wooden cabinet, and a strange contraption that takes up most of the northern end of the room.<br></blockquote><br>Two <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZDEyNGZjZjBkNzE2 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>vine blights</a></strong> and one <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YTdmMjgwYzBiMTA2 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>druid</a></strong> (NE female human) are in the room unless they have been drawn elsewhere, If they are here, read:<br><br><blockquote>Three creatures are here. One appears human but is so caked with dirt and mud that it’s hard to know for sure. Her hair is full of twigs, and her face is hidden behind a veil of moss. She is rooting through the contents of the cabinet and haphazardly tossing them onto the floor. Behind her stand two creatures made entirely of dead vines.</blockquote><br>The druid and the vine blights fight to the death.<br><br>Inside the cabinet is a key hanging on a loop of twine. The key unlocks the padlock on the sliding doors between the veranda (area W5) and the fermentation vats (area W9).<br><br>The contraption standing near the north wall is a printing press, which Davian Martikov uses to make wine bottle labels. The ink is made from wine and stored in bottles in the cabinet, along with pieces of parchment and jars of glue.</section>","img":"modules/cor-cos/journal/012_-_Chapter_12_3A_The_Wizard_of_Wines/002_-_Wizard_of_Wines_Winery/avatar.webp"}

The serenity of the place was forever shattered when Strahd led a bloody crusade against the enemies of his family that ended here with the slaughter of hundreds.

Trail</h3><blockquote>The trail through the thick woods leads to a hill covered with dead grass and cairns of black rock. Dark, ominous clouds gather high above, and a single bolt of lightning strikes the hilltop. West of the hill, the land, the woods, and the sky vanish behind a towering wall of fog.</blockquote>The trail splits as it climbs the hillside, forming two concentric rings (area Y2). The trail also leads to the hilltop (areas Y3 and Y4). The wall of fog (area Y5) marks the edge of Strahd’s domain.<br><hr><h3>Y2. Berserker Cairns</h3><blockquote>Dirt trails run along two concentric rings of cairns that encircle the hillside. Each cairn is a ten-foot-high mound of slimy black rocks.<br></blockquote>These burial mounds predate the arrival of Strahd and the druids. They have remained undisturbed for centuries. Buried under the rocks are the moldy bones of an ancient tribe of berserkers that once lived in the mountains. (See \"Blood Spear of Kavan\" in <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MWU1Y2U5MmRhOGQ0 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Special Events: Chapter 14</a>.<br><hr><h3>Y3. Druids' Circle</h3><blockquote>Atop the hill is a wide ring of black boulders and smaller rocks that collectively form a makeshift wall enclosing a field of dead grass. Lightning strikes the edge of the ring from time to time, illuminating a ghastly, fifty-foot-tall statue made of tightly woven twigs and packed with black earth. The statue resembles a towering, cloaked man with fangs.</blockquote>The ring of boulders that surrounds the field is 250 feet in diameter and ranges from 5 to 10 feet high. Any creature that climbs over the black boulders has a 10 percent chance of being struck by lightning, taking 44 (8d10) lightning damage. Characters can avoid the damage by sticking to the two trails that pass through the ring.<br><br><h4>Wooden Statue</h4>The giant statue bears an eerie resemblance to Strahd von Zarovich. Close inspection reveals roots sprouting from the ground around its base. These roots are part of the Gulthias tree in area Y4. They wrap around the statue, providing added support and durability. The roots not only prevent the statue from being toppled but also allow the effigy to serve as a component in a ritual to create a tree blight (see “Druids’ Ritual” in <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MWU1Y2U5MmRhOGQ0 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Special Events: Chapter 14</a>). Planted in the “heart” of this wooden effigy is a magic gem stolen from the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZTRkYjc1NzhiYjcz ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Wizard of Wines winery</a> (chapter 12).<br><br>\nThe statue has AC 10, 50 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. If the statue takes fire damage after being splashed with oil, it catches fire, taking 2d6 fire damage each round. If the statue is reduced to 0 hit points, it collapses, and the magic gem tumbles onto the field, glowing with a bright green light.<br><br><h4>Hidden Graves</h4>Hidden throughout the field inside the boulders are six <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YTdmMjgwYzBiMTA2 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>druids</a></strong> (CE male and female humans) and six <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OTAwYTNkNjI5MzZm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>berserkers</a></strong> (CE male and female humans), all descendants of the ancient mountain tribe whose members are buried on this hill and all covered head to toe in bluish-gray mud. They have long, tangled hair and wild-looking eyes. To honor their dark “god,” they sleep in earthen graves hidden under covers made of sod and dead grass. Characters entering the circle who have a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 16 or higher notice the dozen covered graves scattered throughout the field. The druids and the berserkers rise from their graves and attack if anyone approaches or damages the statue, or if they are discovered and attacked.<br><br>\nThe druids are waiting to begin a ritual to summon forth an enormous tree blight. Only one druid is needed to complete the ritual, but the druids won’t begin without Strahd’s blessing. Thus, they are waiting for him to appear. The ritual can’t be completed if the statue is destroyed or the magic gem is removed.<br>\nIf the characters discern or divine the gem’s location with the aid of magic, they can try to dig the gem out of the statue’s chest. Climbing up the statue is a simple matter, requiring no ability check, and a character within reach of the chest cavity can use an action to dig into it. Have that character’s player roll a d20: on a result of 13 or higher, the character unearths the gem and can take it as part of his or her action.<br><br><h4>Development</h4>If the druids and the berserkers are killed, their numbers are replenished as others return from forays into the Svalich Woods. At the end of each day, at dusk, 1d4 − 1 druids and 1d4 − 1 berserkers arrive until there are six of each.<br><hr><h3>Y4. Gulthias Tree</h3><blockquote>At the south end of the hilltop is a sickly copse, a grove of dead trees and shrubs with a huge, misshapen tree at its core. Blood oozes like sap from its twisted trunk. Skulking around the tree are six gangly humanoid creatures covered with needles. Embedded in the tree is a shiny battleaxe, beneath which lies a humanoid skeleton.</blockquote><br>The tree is a <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZmYwN2QxYTRiNTc5 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Gulthias tree</a>, the roots of which extend deep beneath the hill. Lurking among the dead trees and shrubs are three <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZDEyNGZjZjBkNzE2 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>vine blights</a></strong>, six <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=N2Q4MGZmNDkzYzMy ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>needle blights</a></strong>, and twelve <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=Y2ZjZGVkNzE0MzQ5 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>twig blights</a></strong>. The needle blights are plainly visible, but the False Appearance feature of the vine blights and the twig blights allows them to hide in plain sight. The blights attack anyone who harms the Gulthias tree, which has no actions or effective attacks of its own.<br><br>The Gulthias tree has AC 15, 250 hit points, and immunity to bludgeoning, piercing, and psychic damage. If it is reduced to 0 hit points, it seems to be destroyed but isn’t truly dead; it regains 1 hit point every month until it is fully healed. With a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Nature) check, a character can determine that the entire stump must be uprooted for the tree to truly die. The Gulthias tree withers and dies in 3d10 days if a <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=ZTBlNjg0MDYwNmE0 ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>hallow</a></em> spell is cast in its area.<br><br>\nThe Gulthias tree creates blights from ordinary plants and is the only tree of its kind in Barovia. If the Gulthias tree is killed, no new blights can be created within Strahd’s domain. Award the party 1,500 XP for destroying the Gulthias tree.<br><br>\nThe skeleton lying at the base of the Gulthias tree is all that remains of a human adventurer who was killed by blights while trying to cut down the tree.<br><br><h4>Treasure</h4>The dead adventurer’s tattered leather armor isn’t salvageable, but the axe embedded in the tree is a magic battleaxe (see <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=Yzg2OTBiZDRjMDE5 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Treebane</a> handout). Its handle is carved with leaves and vines, and the weapon weighs half as much as a normal battleaxe. When the axe hits a plant, whether an ordinary plant or a plant creature, the target takes an extra 1d8 slashing damage. When a creature of non-good alignment wields the axe, it sprouts thorns whenever its wielder makes an attack with it. These thorns prick the wielder for 1 piercing damage after the attack is made, and this damage is considered magical.<br><br><h4><span style=\"color: rgb( 99 , 36 , 35 )\">Fortunes of Ravenloft</span></h4>If your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it’s buried amid the roots of the Gulthias tree, beneath the skeleton of the dead adventurer. Characters who dig in the ground under the skeleton automatically find it.<br><hr><h3>Y5. Wall of Fog</h3>Yester Hill gets its name from a strange phenonmenon that can be observed by anyone who looks into the mists from the hilltop or the western hillside.<br><br><blockquote>As you look west into the curtain of fog, you see a white fortress on a hill above a great city. The city appears quite distant, maybe a mile away. The fog obscures all detail, but you can hear what sounds like the echo of a church bell.</blockquote>The Dark Powers have created a false image of Strahd’s ancestral home within the fog, just beyond reach. <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTZiYzA5N2ViNTZi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Strahd</a> comes to the hill on occasion to gaze upon the city, even though he knows it can’t be real. The image tantalizes him.<br>\nAny creature that enters the deadly fog is subject to its effects (see the \"Mists of Ravenloft\" in <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=M2Y0ZjdlMmFhN2Fj ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Lay of the Land</a>).<br><br>\nIf the characters ask an NPC spellcaster about this part of the wall of fog, that person might relate an ancient legend about it. According to the mountain folk of Barovia, there was always a wall of mist near Yester Hill, even before the deadly mists entrapped all of Barovia.<br><br>The ancient folk called the mist the Whispering Wall, for within it they could hear the whisper of voices from the past and the future. They believed that an ancient god gave up his divinity to preserve the world from destruction and that his last exhalation as a god produced this mist. Within it were all his memories of the world and all his visions of its possible futures, and with proper preparation, a seeker could go on a vision quest within it.<br><br>Some students of the arcane contend that the Dark Powers took a bit of that fog and twisted it to create the mists of Barovia, and that perhaps Strahd’s domain is just a dark memory in the Whispering Wall.<br></section>","img":"modules/cor-cos/journal/014_-_Chapter_14_3A_Yester_Hill/001_-_Yester_Hill/avatar.webp"}

The infected creature gains one level of exhaustion that can’t be removed until the disease is cured.<br><br>Any event that causes the infected creature great stress—including entering combat, taking damage, experiencing fear, or having a nightmare—forces the creature to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw.

Its goal is to continue the work of the cult by luring visitors to their doom.

The house has wooden floors throughout, and all windows have hinges that allow them to swing outward.<br><br>The rooms on the first and second floors are free of dust and signs of age.

These areas are dusty and drafty, everything within them is old and draped in cobwebs, and the floorboards groan underfoot.<br><br>Ceilings vary in height by floor. The first floor has 10-foot-high ceilings, the second floor has 12-foot-high ceilings, the third floor has 8-foot-high ceilings, and the attic has 13-foot-high ceilings.<br><br>None of the rooms in the house are lit when the characters arrive, although most areas contain working oil lamps or fireplaces.<br><br>Characters can burn the house to the ground if they want, but any destruction to the house is temporary. After 1d10 days, the house begins to repair itself. Ashes sweep together to form blackened timbers, which then turn back into a sturdy wooden frame around which walls begin to materialize. Destroyed furnishings are likewise repaired. It takes 2d6 hours for the house to complete its resurrection. Items taken from the house aren’t replaced, nor are undead that are destroyed. The dungeon level isn’t considered part of the house and can’t repair itself in this fashion.<br><br><h3>Dungeon Features</h3>The dungeon level underneath Death House is carved out of earth, clay, and rock. The tunnels are 4 feet wide by 7 feet high with timber braces at 5-foot intervals. Rooms are 8 feet tall and supported by thick wooden posts with crossbeams. The only exception is area 38, which has a 16-foot-high ceiling supported by stone pillars. Characters without darkvision must provide their own light sources, as the dungeon is unlit.<br><br>As the characters explore the dungeon, they see centuries-old human footprints in the earthen floor leading every which way.<br></section>","img":"modules/cor-cos/journal/018_-_Appendix_B_3A_Death_House/001_-_Death_House_E2_80_99s_Features/avatar.webp"}

West Staircases</h3><blockquote>Narrow windows illuminate this dusty, five-foot-wide spiral staircase.</blockquote><br>These staircases connect the second-floor balconies (area Q18) to <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MmM3OGViZjlhNDM3 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>areas Q30 and Q36</a> on the third floor.<br><br><hr><br><h3>Q18. Balconies</h3><blockquote>Two stone balconies flank the main foyer. Balusters carved to resemble knights in shining armor support their elegantly carved stone railings. Weapons and shields festoon the walls along each of these walkways, while alabaster busts of handsome men flank hallways that lead north and south away from the foyer. At the west end of each balcony is an archway that leads to a spiral staircase going up.</blockquote><br>The balcony is 20 feet above the floor of the foyer (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=OGZkMWVkZjExOTc5 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area Q3</a>). The weapons and shields hanging on the walls are nonmagical. The busts, displayed atop wooden pedestals, depict various human guises of the dragon Argynvost. Their eyes seem to watch the characters as they walk by, but the effect is an optical illusion.<br><br><hr><br><h3>Q19. Ruined Bedchambers</h3>There are two of these rooms.<br><br><blockquote>The south end of this room has collapsed, exposing the chamber to the elements. A few furnishings lie broken under fallen debris from the level above.</blockquote><br>The wooden floor creaks underfoot. Although it is safe to walk on, doing so attracts the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YzYzMzhjZmFkMjU4 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>giant spiders</a> from <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=OGZkMWVkZjExOTc5 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area Q4</a>. The spiders crawl up into the room and attack. The floor here is 20 feet above the floor of the ballroom.<br><br><hr><br><h3>Q20. South Alcove</h3><blockquote>A red velvet curtain hangs in front of an alcove in the southeast corner of this hall. It ripples ever so slightly.</blockquote><br>One of the narrow windows in the back of the alcove has a broken glass pane through which a slight breeze passes, causing the curtain to move. When the characters look behind the curtain, read:<br><br><blockquote>A black cloth covers something atop a white marble pedestal</blockquote><br>Beneath the black cloth is the severed head of a randomly determined character—an illusion created by Strahd’s consciousness. In actuality, it’s an exquisite alabaster bust of a handsome, middle-aged human with a neatly trimmed mustache and beard (Lord Argynvost). The illusion is too strong to be disbelieved, but it can be dispelled if the bust is broken or covered up again.<br><br><hr><br><h3>Q21. North Alcove</h3><blockquote>A red velvet curtain hangs in front of an alcove in the northeast corner of this hall.</blockquote><br>The alcove is empty except for the narrow windows in the back walls. Whenever the characters part the curtain and leave, the curtain is closed when they return. Only by removing the curtain from its rod can they prevent the curtain from closing on its own.<br><br><hr><br><h3>Q22. Bathroom</h3><blockquote>The room contains an iron tub and has wood paneling on the walls that rises to a height of three feet. Above the paneling, the walls are painted with a continuous, faded mural of a mountainscape.</blockquote><br>The mural accurately depicts the Balinok Mountains.<br><br><hr><br><h3>Q23. Storage Room</h3><blockquote>Rainwater seeps through cracks in the ceiling and flows into a pool on the sagging wooden floor. The pool fills about half the room. Bare stone shelves line the walls.</blockquote><br>This room has been thoroughly looted. The wooden floor is soft and spongy, and it can’t support more than 100 pounds of weight. If more weight is applied, the floor collapses, and any creature in the room falls 20 feet, taking damage as normal and landing in <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=OGZkMWVkZjExOTc5 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area Q12</a>.<br><br><hr><br><h3>Q24. Chapel Balcony</h3><blockquote>This wooden balcony overhangs the mansion’s chapel. An exquisitely carved wooden throne rests at the west end between two doors, and narrow archways lead to spiral staircases going up and down. Hanging from the high ceiling is an iron chandelier with candle holders shaped like tiny silver dragons.</blockquote><br>The doors behind the throne lead to areas Q20 and Q21. A wooden railing surrounds the balcony, which is 20 feet above the floor of the chapel (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=OGZkMWVkZjExOTc5 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area Q13</a>).<br><br><hr><br><h3>Q25. Trapped Hallway</h3><blockquote>This T-shaped hallway has branches to the west, east, and south. Three arched windows in the north wall look out over the foggy grounds.</blockquote><br>The ceiling in the hall is 20 feet high. The wooden doors to areas Q27 and Q28 are locked, requiring a successful DC 20 Strength check to break down. The 10-foot squares in front of the doors (marked T on the map) are trapped. When a character enters one of these squares, a floor-to-ceiling wall of stone (created by the spell of the same name) magically appears across the opening on the south wall. At the same time, the <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MTIwYWVmYTUyY2Y5 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>phantom warriors</a></strong> in areas Q27 and Q28 rush through the doors (which can be freely opened from their side) and attack.<br><br>\nThe wall of stone vanishes after 10 minutes, at which time the trap resets. Characters who cast a <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=ZGFkZjk1MTVlNDI3 ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>detect magic</a></em> spell in the hall can perceive hazy auras of evocation magic in front of the doors.<br><br><hr><br><br><h3>Q26. Northeast Guest Room</h3>The door to this room hangs open.<br><br><blockquote>Two beds with torn canopies stand against opposite walls with a tattered rug lying on the floor between them. Set into the far wall is a fireplace black with soot. A soft hiss issues from the hearth.</blockquote><br>When one or more characters approach within 10 feet of the fireplace, add:<br><br><blockquote>A small, hissing dragon made of ash and smoke erupts from the fireplace, filling the room with soot as it beats its wings.</blockquote><br>The smoky dragonet has the statistics of a <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YWQ5ZDQyMGZjMmJk ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>smoke mephit</a></strong> but fights only in self-defense. If left alone, it flies out of the room at a speed of 30 feet, up the spiral staircase (area Q17), through the curtain at <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MmM3OGViZjlhNDM3 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area Q30</a>, over the rubble in <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MmM3OGViZjlhNDM3 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area Q33</a>, and into <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MmM3OGViZjlhNDM3 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area Q36</a>. Once there, it lands on the back of Vladimir's throne and disappears.<br><br><hr><br><h3>Q27. Knights' Quarters</h3><blockquote>This room is littered with the wreckage of ancient bunk beds. Five dirt-caked windows allow precious little light to enter, and between them are four empty armor stands. Empty torch sconces line the walls.</blockquote><br>Four <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MTIwYWVmYTUyY2Y5 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>phantom warriors</a></strong> haunt this room. They manifest only when the characters enter the room or trigger the magic trap in area Q25. They fight until destroyed.<br><br><hr><br><h3>Q28. Knights' Quarters</h3><blockquote>Tattered and faded drapes cover the windows of this circular room, and empty torch sconces line the walls. Broken bunk beds and armor stands are strewn on the floor.</blockquote><br>Three <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MTIwYWVmYTUyY2Y5 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>phantom warriors</a></strong> haunt this room. They manifest only when the characters enter the room or trigger the magic trap in area Q25. They fight until destroyed.<br><br><h4>Treasure</h4>Buried under the wreckage is a small wooden coffer containing four <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=M2I0NDgyMmNlNGVm ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>potions of invulnerability</a></em>. A search of the room yields this lost cache.<br><br><hr><br><h3>Q29. Northwest Guest Room</h3><blockquote>The contents of this room are draped in cobwebs. Between curtained windows stands a black marble hearth with a sculpted mantelpiece, above which hangs a framed portrait of a handsome, well-dressed man with a wry smile and a thick mane of thistledown hair. Opposite the fireplace is a large bed with a rotting mattress and wooden posts carved to resemble dragons. Across from the double doors stands a tall wardrobe, its doors hanging open, revealing a dark and empty cavity. The only other piece of furniture is an overstuffed leather chair that faces the hearth.</blockquote><br>The portrait depicts the silver dragon Argynvost in its guise as the human noble Lord Argynvost.<br></section>","img":"modules/cor-cos/journal/007_-_Chapter_7_3A_Argynvostholt/004_-_Argynvostholt_Second_Floor/avatar.webp"}

They needed a vault in which to contain the evil vestiges (remnants of dead, malevolent entities) they had captured and the hoard of forbidden knowledge they had amassed. They dedicated the temple to a god of secrets, whom they trusted to keep it hidden from the rest of the world until the end of time. Unfortunately for the wizards, even the will of a god couldn’t prevent other evil creatures from learning the temple’s location. The wizards were forced to guard the temple themselves, to keep its secrets from falling into villainous hands. The evil forces that were imprisoned within the temple eventually corrupted the wizards, turning them against one another.<br><br>The wizards were dead and gone by the time an evil archmage named <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZGE1ZGUyOTEyMTI1 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Exethanter</a> arrived at the temple. He breached the temple’s wards, spoke to a vestige trapped in amber, and discovered the secret to becoming a lich. After his transformation, the lich Exethanter took over the temple and turned the skulls of it previous defenders into <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NzkzZWE0YTFkZDc2 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>flameskulls</a> under his command. Exethanter then took it upon himself to watch over the temple, not to hoard its evil secrets but to share them openly. Meanwhile, the evils within the temple fed on each other, growing in power.<br><br>When Strahd came to the temple seeking immortality, Exethanter sensed that he was a man of destiny. The evil powers in the temple felt something much stronger: a darkness that eclipsed their own. Strahd communed with these evil vestiges and forged a pact with them. When Strahd later murdered his brother Sergei, that pact was sealed with blood. Strahd transformed into a vampire, and the Dark Powers turned his land into a prison.<br><br>Strahd has returned to the temple several times to learn new magic and to find a means of escaping his fate, but the Dark Powers have no intention of giving him up. These recent years have been difficult for Exethanter, whose body and mind have been falling apart. The lich has grown weak and forgetful. He no longer remembers his name or his spells. He knows only that the Dark Powers that created Strahd’s domain were born in the temple, and that these entities feed on the evil that Strahd represents. Strahd is the darkness that sustains them.<br><br>Characters who visit the temple can sense the presence of great evil. The dark vestiges imprisoned within the temple will try to corrupt them, offering them secrets and gifts in exchange for a taste of the evil that lurks within their true hearts.<br><br><blockquote>\"I would not be called ‘death’ so soon.

Unless otherwise noted, arrow slits in the temple are 5 inches wide, 4 feet tall, and 1 foot thick.<br><br><hr><br><h3>X1.

When the characters reach the end of this road, read:<br><br><blockquote>The road fades away under a covering of snow, but it takes you far enough to see the facade of some kind of temple carved into the sheer mountainside ahead. The front of the structure is fifty feet high and has six alcoves containing twenty-foot-tall statues. Each statue is carved from a single block of amber and depicts a faceless, hooded figure, its hands pressed together in a gesture of prayer. Between the two innermost statues is a twenty-foot-tall archway with a staircase leading down.</blockquote><br>The amber statues are impervious to damage. Looking at one for long fills a viewer with unease.<br><br><hr><br><h3>X1a. Narrow Fissure</h3>A natural fissure has opened in the mountainside west of the temple’s facade, creating a gap two feet wide, ten feet tall, and fifteen feet deep. You see light coming from a room beyond, and you hear human voices there as well.<br><br>The fissure leads to area X15. If the characters make a lot of noise outside, one of the creatures in that area investigates the disturbance.<br><br><hr><br><h3>X2. Entrance</h3>If the characters pass through the archway between the statues, read:<br><br><blockquote>Icy steps descend ten feet to a time-ravaged hallway with arrow slits in the walls. Beyond the hall lies a vast, sepulchral darkness.</blockquote><br>The hall connects areas X1 and X4. There are no guards in the rooms behind the arrow slits (areas X2a and X2b).<br><br><hr><br><h3>X2a. Guard Room</h3>This empty room lies behind a secret door. The ceiling is 10 feet high. Two arrow slits are carved into the east wall.<br><br><hr><br><h3>X2b. Guard Room</h3>This room lies behind a secret door.<br><br><blockquote>Two arrow slits are carved into the west wall of this 10-foot-high, twenty-foot-square room.

Black marble staircases at each end of the balcony descend thirty feet to the temple floor. The vaulted ceiling is thirty feet above the balcony. The walls and ceiling are covered in an amber glaze, lending the gloom a golden sheen. A set of amber doors stands closed at the west end of the balcony. A similar pair stands open to the east.</blockquote><br>Anyone with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 12 or higher notice arrow slits in the walls overlooking the temple (see areas X8 and X17 for more information on these arrow slits). If the characters’ light source or vision extends 90 feet or more, they can see a large, faceless statue at the far end of the temple (area X5a).<br><br>The open doorway to the east leads to area X6. The double doors to the west open into area X15. Characters who listen at the western doors hear gruff humanoid voices beyond, but can’t discern what’s being said.<br><br><hr><br><h3>X5. Temple of Lost Secrets</h3><blockquote>Four black marble columns support the vaulted ceiling of the temple, at the north end of which stands a forty-foot-tall statue of a cowled figure in flowing robes. The statue’s stony hands are outstretched as if in the midst of casting a spell. Its face is a void of utter blackness.<br><br>The ominous statue stands between two black marble balconies, one of which has partially collapsed and fallen on the temple’s black marble floor, in front of an open doorway. The walls of the temple are sheathed in amber, and the doors leading from it are made of amber as well. Arched hallways coated with amber lead away from the temple to the west and east. Flanking these exits are alcoves that hold white marble statues of robed human wizards with pointed hats and golden staffs. One of them has toppled over and lies shattered on the floor.</blockquote><br>An <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ODhhYmViZWU0YmFi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>arcanaloth</a></strong> named Neferon guards this temple from within the hollow head of the great statue (area X5a) and attacks characters on sight with its longer-ranged spells.

Characters can’t see Neferon unless they can penetrate the magical darkness that envelops the statue’s face and head.<br><br>Once the arcanaloth begins casting spells, the three <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NzkzZWE0YTFkZDc2 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>flameskulls</a></strong> in area X17 take up positions behind the arrow slits that overlook the temple and cast <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=NTBkMDE5OWQxZWQz ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>magic missile</a></em> and <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=ZTRkNjIxMmM1ZjAx ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>fireball</a></em> spells at characters they can see.<br><br>The temple ceiling is 60 feet high. Wide, black marble staircases ascend 30 feet to the southern balcony (area X4). The balconies that flank the statue (areas X11 and X23) are 30 feet high as well.<br><br>Arrow slits cut into the walls of the upper galleries (areas X8 and X17) and archer posts (areas X13 and X25) look down on the temple. The amber glaze that covers the temple walls makes these arrow slits difficult to spot. Characters who have a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 12 or higher notice them. Creatures behind the arrow slits gain three-quarters cover.<br><br>The marble wizard statues stand 8 feet tall. Their 9-foot-tall golden staffs are made of wrought iron coated in peeling gold paint. The northeast statue fell over when an earth tremor collapsed the wall of its alcove.<br><br><hr><br><h3>X5a. God of Secrets</h3>This 40-foot-tall statue, carved out of granite, depicts a faceless god of secrets. At the base of the statue, in the back, is a secret door that can be found with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check. It can be pulled open to reveal a spiral staircase that climbs to a stone trapdoor set into the floor of the statue’s hollow head.<br><br><h4>Statue’s Head</h4>Neferon the <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ODhhYmViZWU0YmFi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>arcanaloth</a></strong> lairs inside the statue’s hollow head, within a field of magical darkness that fills the interior of the head and hides the statue’s humanlike face. The darkness can be dispelled (DC 17).<br><br>A pair of 2-foot-wide eyeholes provides an unobstructed view of the temple floor south of the statue, as well as the southern balcony (area X4). Looking through the eyes, one can’t see the northern balconies (areas X11 and X23), the areas beneath them, or anywhere behind or directly above the statue. The eyeholes grant the arcanaloth three-quarters cover against attacks that originate outside the head.<br><br>Neferon wears gold spectacles and a magic robe (see “Treasure” below). It uses its <em>alter self</em> spell and Deception skill to pass itself off as an old human wizard with a long white beard named Heinrich Stolt. “Heinrich” feigns confusion. If the characters ask him why he attacked, he claims that he was guarding the temple. If the arcanaloth loses more than half of its hit points, it teleports to the temple floor, turns invisible, and flees by the safest route, attacking the characters again when it’s safe to do so. The arcanaloth will not, under any circumstances, leave the Amber Temple.<br><br><h4>Treasure</h4>The <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ODhhYmViZWU0YmFi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>arcanaloth</a> carries a spellbook containing the wizard spells it has prepared (see its stat block). It wears small gold spectacles with pink crystal lenses (worth 250 gp) and a <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NTUyNWE4ZmEyOWEy ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>robe of useful items</a></em> with the following eight patches remaining:<br><br><ul><li>Bag of 100 gp</li><li>Iron door</li><li>Wooden ladder</li><li>Riding horse</li><li>Pit</li><li>Rowboat</li><li><em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MTE4ZDc2ZGNkMWQ3 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Spell scroll</a></em> (<em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=YmRlYjQwNmQwYjEx ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>moonbeam</a></em>)</li><li>Mastiffs</li></ul>See the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NTUyNWE4ZmEyOWEy ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i><em>Robe of Useful Items</em></a> handout for more information on each patch.<br><br><h4><span style=\"color: rgb( 99 , 36 , 35 )\">Fortunes of Ravenloft</span></h4>If your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it’s lying on the floor inside the statue’s head.<br><br><hr><br><h3>X5b. Secret Door</h3>Set into the middle of the temple’s north wall is a secret door. A character who searches the wall for secret doors and succeeds on a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check detects seams in the amber glaze that covers the wall, hinting at the presence of the door. It is warded by an <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=ODJiZjI0Y2ZjN2Vk ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>arcane lock</a></em> spell that prevents it from being opened, but knocking on the door three times causes it to swing open for 1 minute, revealing a dusty stone staircase. The stairs climb 30 feet to another secret door that swings open automatically when a creature moves within 5 feet of it. The stairs lead to area X30.<br><br>X5c and X5d can be found in <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NjAxOTQ4MWE0MmMy ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>The Amber Temple Lower Floor</a>.<br><br><hr><br><h3>X6. Southeast Annex</h3><blockquote>This room is featureless except for a rough-edged, 10-foot-diameter circular hole in the floor to the east and empty torch sconces along the walls. Double doors of amber stand open to the north and west. A single closed door lies just south of the western set of double doors.</blockquote><br>The ceiling here is 20 feet high. Beyond the open doors to the north, the characters can see a long, wide hallway with amber-covered walls (area X8).<br><br>The hole in the floor forms a roughly hewn shaft that descends 20 feet, then breaks through the ceiling of <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NjAxOTQ4MWE0MmMy ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area X33a</a>. From the bottom of the shaft, it’s another 10-foot drop to the floor of area X33a. The shaft has abundant handholds and can be climbed without an ability check, but characters must still drop the last 10 feet to reach the floor below. If the characters make a lot of noise, the three <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NzkzZWE0YTFkZDc2 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>flameskulls</a></strong> in area X33a float up the shaft and attack them. The flameskulls also attack anyone they can hear attempting to descend the shaft.<br><br>A secret door in the south wall opens into area X7.<br><br><hr><br><h3>X7. Secret Scroll Repository</h3><blockquote>Carved into the south wall of this dusty space are cylindrical holes fit for scrolls or maps.<br></blockquote><br>The wizards kept magic scrolls here in case the temple came under attack. The scrolls have crumbled to dust.<br><br><hr><br><h3>X8. Upper East Hall</h3><blockquote>Glazed amber covers the walls of this twenty-foot-wide, seventy-foot-long arched corridor. The amber doors at both ends of the hall stand open. A closed door is in the middle of the east wall, and three arrow slits are cut into the wall across from it. Cracks in the black marble floor run the length of the hall.<br></blockquote><br>The cracks in the floor were made by the golem in area X10. The arrow slits are 5 inches wide, 2½ feet tall, and 1 foot thick. They look down on the temple (area X5).<br><br><hr><br><h3>X9. Lecture Hall</h3><blockquote>This chamber is brightly lit by red copper lanthorns that hang from the ceiling. The walls are sheathed in amber that has been shaped into bas-reliefs of wizards with spellbooks. Stairs to the north and south descend twenty feet to an obsidian lectern, behind which a slab of black slate hangs from chains. Between the stairs are descending rows of red marble benches.</blockquote><br>The hanging lanthorns have <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=ZWZmZjdkNzM5ZmU4 ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>continual light</a></em> spells cast on them. The black slate slab once served as a chalkboard and has a few chalk marks on it.<br><br>Hiding behind the lectern is <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZWE3YzA2MzVhNTM0 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i><strong>Vilnius</strong></a><strong> </strong>(NE male human) and his invisible <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YTM0YjQ4ZjllOGQz ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>quasit</a></strong> familiar. Characters who have a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 17 or higher notice him. A character who actively searches the room for hidden occupants spots Vilnius with a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check.<br><br>Vilnius wears scorched robes, his unkempt hair is half burned away, and his face and arms are covered with blisters from magic fire. He is the apprentice of Jakarion, the dead wizard in area X17. After the flameskulls there incinerated his master, the wounded Vilnius retreated here. He eats vermin to survive. The amber golem has been patrolling the hallway outside (area X8), and Vilnius won’t leave this room until he knows the golem has been destroyed.<br><br><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZWE3YzA2MzVhNTM0 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Vilnius</a> is a greedy, treacherous coward. He curses his dead master for leading them to this wretched land. If the characters try to befriend him, he is suspicious of their intentions. He would like to retrieve his dead master’s staff and spellbook, but otherwise he has no interest in exploring more of the Amber Temple. He knows the following information about the place:<br><br><ul><li>The temple is a haven for forbidden knowledge.</li><li>Flameskulls—constructs made from the remains of dead wizards—guard the temple.</li><li>Barbaric mountain folk use the temple for shelter.</li></ul><br><h4>Treasure</h4><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZWE3YzA2MzVhNTM0 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Vilnius</a> carries his spellbook, which contains all the spells he has prepared. He also has a gold amulet shaped like an upside-down V hidden under his robes. Of exquisite design, the amulet is worth 1,000 gp. It is the control amulet for the shield guardian in <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NjAxOTQ4MWE0MmMy ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area X35</a>.<br><br>Although he can tell that the amulet is magical, he doesn’t know its purpose. The amulet thrums when it comes within 10 feet of the shield guardian. If Vilnius realizes what the amulet does, he won’t part with it.<br><br><hr><br><h3>X10. Northeast Annex</h3><blockquote>The walls and ceiling in the eastern portion of this bare stone room have collapsed. To the west and south are open amber doors. In the center of the room is a ten-foot-tall statue of a jackal-headed warrior made of cracked amber. It turns to face you and clenches its fists.<br></blockquote><br>The ceiling here is 20 feet high, and the walls are lined with empty torch sconces. The statue is a damaged <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MmIyYTM2YWNmNzQ1 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>amber golem</a></strong>. It has 145 hit points and attacks any creature it sees, stopping only when it can’t see any.<br><br>An earthquake collapsed the eastern part of the room long ago.<br><br><hr><br><h3>X11. Northeast Balcony</h3><blockquote>This black marble balcony, thirty feet above the floor, overhangs the northeast corner of the temple. The two amber doors leading from this balcony stand open.</blockquote><br>Characters can see an arrow slit west of the northern set of doors (see area X13).<br><br><hr><br><h3>X12. East Shrine</h3><blockquote>This bare stone room consists of a foyer to the west and a shrine to the east. Four candlesticks lie on the dusty floor of the foyer. In the shrine, fragments of a shattered obsidian statue are scattered in a raised alcove at the eastern end of the chamber. Two pairs of empty alcoves line the north and south walls of the shrine.</blockquote><br>The amber golem in area X10 knocked over the candlesticks and pulverized the obsidian statue, which depicted the same nameless god that stands in area X5. Amber doors in the west wall open into area X13.<br><br>A secret door is set into the back of one of the alcoves on the north wall. It can be pulled open to area X14.<br><br><hr><br><h3>X13. East Archer Post</h3><blockquote>This narrow room has an arrow slit in the center of the south wall.</blockquote><br>The ceiling here is 10 feet high. The arrow slit looks down toward the temple floor (area X5), beneath the raised left arm of the great statue (area X5a).<br><br><hr><br><h3>X14. North Staircase</h3>When the characters open the secret door at the top of the stairs, read:<br><br><blockquote>A dusty corridor heads north, then bends to the east, descending a dark staircase. The air is thin, but heavy with the stench of death.</blockquote><br>Three 10-foot-long staircases with landings between them descend a total of 30 feet to area X14a. The stench grows stronger down the stairs.<br><br><hr><br><h3>X14a. Collapsed Lower Hall</h3><blockquote>The stairs descend to a collapsed hall with a high ceiling and amber-glazed walls glazed. Rubble covers most of the floor, and a path through the rubble leads to an open doorway. A deathly stench seems to come from there.</blockquote><br>This ruined area once connected to <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NjAxOTQ4MWE0MmMy ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area X32</a>, but an earth tremor caused the ceiling and walls to collapse. The ceiling here is 25 feet high.<br><br>Unless the characters douse their light sources and move quietly, the creatures in <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NjAxOTQ4MWE0MmMy ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area X33c</a> hear them approaching and prepare to attack.<br><br><hr><br><h3>X15. Southwest Annex</h3><br>This room contains a <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MjQ4OGM4YWM3Y2Rl ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>gladiator</a></strong> (CE female human) named Helwa, five <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OTAwYTNkNjI5MzZm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>berserkers</a></strong> (CE male and female humans), and one <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=Y2U1NjM4N2M0ZDgw ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>dire wolf</a></strong>. The gladiator and the berserkers are bloodthirsty mountain folk, the dire wolf a servant of Strahd. The dire wolf can’t be charmed or frightened.<br><br>When they aren’t expecting trouble, the gladiator and the berserkers sit on the floor, sharpening their weapons, while the dire wolf sleeps in the middle of the room. The gladiator and the berserkers fight to the death. The dire wolf flees the temple (heading east, through areas X4 and X2) if reduced to fewer than half its hit points.<br><br><blockquote>Torches in sconces light this bare stone room. Six bedrolls made of stitched animal furs cover the floor. Cold air enters through a fissure in the southwest wall.</blockquote><br>Other than the berserkers’ armor and weapons, there is nothing of value here. The berserkers are aware of the flameskulls (“fiery spirits”) to the north and keep the doors to area X17 closed.<br><br>A fissure has formed in the southwest wall. The gap is 2 feet wide, 10 feet tall, and 15 feet deep. It leads outside (area X1a).<br><br>A secret door in the south wall opens into area X16. Neither the mountain folk nor the dire wolf knows of it.<br><br><h4>Development</h4>The gladiator, Helwa, uses this room as a shelter while hunting in the mountains. She and her berserkers know nothing about the temple’s history or purpose.<br><br><hr><br><h3>X16. West Scroll Repository</h3>Apart from its location, this room is identical to area X7.<br><br><hr><br><h3>X17. Upper West Hall</h3><blockquote>The walls of this twenty-foot-wide, seventy-foot-long arched corridor are sheathed in amber. The southern half of the hall is scorched by fire, and a charred corpse lies on the floor here, under a burned fur cloak. Several amber doors lead from this hall, and three arrow slits are cut into the east wall. Floating in the middle of the hall are three skulls wreathed in green flame.</blockquote><br>Three <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NzkzZWE0YTFkZDc2 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>flameskulls</a></strong> guard this hall, attacking creatures that enter. The flameskulls will not leave the hall.<br><br>The charred corpse is all that remains of a wizard named Jakarion, who came to the Amber Temple seeking power. The flameskulls incinerated the wizard.<br><br>The arrow slits look down on the temple (area X5).<br><br><h4>Treasure</h4>Although the dead wizard’s spellbook didn’t survive, his staff did. It is a <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YWFmNjE1ODViMmFi ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i><em>staff of frost</em></a>. Imprinted on it is a fragment of the wizard’s personality. The first character who touches the staff gains the following flaw: “I crave power above all else, and will do anything to obtain more of it.” This flaw trumps any conflicting personality trait.<br><br><hr><br><h3>X18. Hallway</h3><blockquote>This twenty-foot-long, ten-foot-high hallway of bare stone has an amber door at each end.</blockquote><br>Area X17 lies beyond the door to the east, area X21 beyond the door to the west.<br><br><hr><br><h3>X19. Potion Storage</h3><blockquote>Stone blocks resembling tables stand in the center of this room covered in dust. Carved into the stone walls are niches filled with hundreds of dusty bottles. Cobwebs hang from wooden ladders that lean against the walls.</blockquote><br>The ceiling here is 15 feet high. The bottles contain the dried-up remains of potions that lost their efficacy long ago. The ladders were once used to reach the higher niches, but they can no longer support any weight.<br><br>A secret door is set in the north wall. It can be pulled open to reveal a staircase landing (area X21).<br><br><hr><br><h3>X20. Architect’s Room</h3><blockquote>Dominating this room is a twelve-foot-tall model of a dark castle with high walls and tall spires. Behind it, tucked in a corner, are some ruined furnishings and a wooden chest.</blockquote><br>In the months leading up to the construction of Castle Ravenloft, this room was occupied by the castle’s architect, a wizard named Artimus. He built a scale model of the castle out of magically sculpted rock. Anyone who has seen the castle recognizes this replica for what it is.<br><br>The ceiling here is 15 feet high. A secret door in the south wall can be pulled open to a staircase landing (area X21).<br><br><h4>Treasure</h4>The wooden chest contains an old map case in which Artimus kept floor plans of Castle Ravenloft, but the maps were lost long ago. The chest has a false bottom that can be found with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check. Inside the hidden compartment is a <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MDU1YWM5NGJjOTNh ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>tome of understanding</a></em>.<br><br><h4><span style=\"color: rgb( 99 , 36 , 35 )\">Fortunes of Ravenloft</span></h4>If your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it’s hidden in the miniature castle. The characters must smash their way into the castle to reach it.<br><hr><br><h3>X21. West Staircase</h3>Three 10-foot-long staircases separated by 10-foot-square landings connect areas X18 and X36. Thick dust covering the stairs has not been disturbed in ages.<br><br>The uppermost landing has secret doors set into its north and south walls. The south door opens into area X19, and the north door opens into area X20.<br><br><hr><br><h3>X22. Northwest Annex</h3>When one of the doors to this room is opened, read:<br><br><blockquote>Torches in sconces illuminate a dining table in the center of the room. Covering the table is a magnificent feast that fills the hall with the rich smells of cooked meat, sweet vegetables, piping hot gravy, and wine.</blockquote><br>The ceiling here is 20 feet high. Amber doors lead south to a hallway (area X18) and east to a shattered balcony (area X23).<br><br>The table is real, but the torches, the feast, and the chairs are illusions created by a <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=ZDM0YmExMGU1NzZm ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>programmed illusion</a></em> spell that triggers when a door to the room is opened. <br><br>Physical interaction with the image reveals the torches, feast and chairs to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful intelligence (Investigation) check (DC 17). If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and any noise it makes sounds hollow to the creature. The illusion can be dispelled (DC 17).<br><br>Hidden in plain sight amid the feast on the table is a green copper ewer embossed with images of dancing bears, elks, and wolves. The ewer, like the table, isn’t illusory. A <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=ZGFkZjk1MTVlNDI3 ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>detect magic</a></em> spell reveals an aura of transmutation magic around the ewer. If a character picks up the ewer, the illusions fade away (including the torches and their light), and seven <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OTJmMjVhNzNlOWY0 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>specters</a></strong> materialize and attack whoever has the ewer.<br><br><h4>Treasure</h4>Any poisonous liquid poured into the ewer is instantly transformed into an equal amount of sweet wine. Furthermore, a creature that grasps the ewer’s handle can command the ewer to fill with 1 gallon of wine, and it can’t produce more wine until the next dawn.<br><br>Many unscrupulous Barovians and Vistani would kill to obtain this ewer. Others would gladly pay for it or accept it as a gift.<br><br><hr><br><h3>X23. Northwest Balcony</h3><br><blockquote>This black marble balcony overhangs the northwest corner of the temple, the floor of which lies thirty feet below. Nearly half of the balcony has fallen away, and obvious cracks have formed near its ragged edge.</blockquote><br>This balcony is unsafe. Weight in excess of 250 pounds causes it to collapse. Any creature on the balcony when it collapses falls 30 feet to the temple floor below.<br><br>Characters can see an arrow slit east of the northern set of doors (see area X25).<br><br><hr><br><h3>X24. West Shrine</h3><blockquote>This bare stone room consists of a foyer to the east and a shrine to the west. Candlesticks draped in cobwebs stand in the four corners of the foyer. In the shrine, a faceless obsidian statue stands in a raised alcove at the western end of the chamber. Slumped before the statue are two desiccated corpses in tattered garments. Two pairs of alcoves line the north and south walls of the shrine.</blockquote><br>The obsidian statue is 4 feet tall, weighs 250 pounds, and depicts the same nameless god that stands watch in the main temple (area X5). Any living creature that enters this room must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be drawn to the statue as though affected by the sympathy effect of an <em><a href=\"https://5e.tools/spells.html#antipathy%2fsympathy_phb\">antipathy/sympathy</a></em> spell. <br><br>The enchantment causes the creatures to feel an intense urge to approach the statue while within 60 feet of it or able to see it. When such a creature can see the statue or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or use its movement on each of its turns to enter the area or move within reach of the target. When the creature has done so, it can't willingly move away from the target.<br><br>If an affected creature ends its turn while not within 60 feet of the target or able to see it, the creature makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the creature is no longer affected by the target and recognizes the feeling of repugnance or attraction as magical. In addition, a creature affected by the spell is allowed another Wisdom saving throw every 24 hours while the spell persists.<br><br>A creature that successfully saves against this effect is immune to it for 1 minute, after which time it can be affected again.<br><br>The corpses lying in front of the statue are the remains of two human wizards who came here separately, failed their saving throws, and starved to death while under the spell’s effect. The lich in area X27 destroyed the wizards’ spellbooks and other possessions. Covering the statue or removing it from this shrine suppresses its magic and ends its sympathy effect on anyone.<br><br>A pair of amber doors in the east wall open into area X25. A secret door is set in the back of one of the northern alcoves. Pulling it open releases hundreds of skulls (see area X26).<br><br><hr><br><h3>X25. West Archer Post</h3><blockquote>This narrow room has an arrow slit in the center of the south wall.<br></blockquote><br>The ceiling here is 10 feet high. The arrow slit looks down toward the temple floor (area X5), beneath the raised right arm of the great statue (area X5a).<br><br><hr><br><h3>X26. Secret Alcove</h3>Two secret doors lead to this room. When either door is pulled open, read:<br><br><blockquote>Hundreds of skulls fall out of a cavity behind the door.</blockquote><br>This room has a 30-foot-high ceiling and is packed floor to ceiling with human skulls. It takes 5 minutes for a single character to clear a path into the room. Multiple characters can work together to clear a path more quickly. Once the skulls are cleared away, characters can search the room.<br><br><blockquote>Attached to the thirty-foot-high ceiling of this dark sepulcher is an upside-down iron chest with a barrel-shaped lid.</blockquote><br>The iron chest on the ceiling is held in place with <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YWFiYzA0MTk4ODhm ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>sovereign glue</a></em>, and its lid is sealed with an <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=ODJiZjI0Y2ZjN2Vk ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>arcane lock</a> </em>spell. The chest is impervious to weapon damage. Prying it open requires a successful DC 25 Strength check, assuming the characters can reach it. The inside of the chest is lined with lead.<br><br>If the chest’s lid is opened, the floor of this room disappears (as if affected by a <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=NjIxOWQ2MTFhMDk2 ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>disintegrate</a></em> spell), creating a 10-foot-square hole above <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NjAxOTQ4MWE0MmMy ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area X39</a>. Creatures standing on the floor when it disappears fall 30 feet, landing in the northwest corner of area X39.<br><br>The iron chest is empty.<br><br><hr><br><h3>X27. Lich’s Lair</h3><blockquote>This fifteen-foot-high room contains the trappings of royalty: ornate furniture, exquisite rugs and tapestries, and decorative statuary. Everywhere you look are lit candelabras atop small tables. The beauty of the decor is undone by thick dust and cobwebs. Standing in the center of the room is a decrepit skeleton clad in tattered robes.<br><br>Red pinpoints of light burn in the skeleton’s eye sockets. “Do I know you?” it asks.</blockquote><br>The lich has fewer hit points than normal (99 hit points), doesn’t remember its name (<strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZGE1ZGUyOTEyMTI1 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Exethanter</a></strong>), and has forgotten all of its prepared spells. It does know its cantrips.In its current condition, the lich has a challenge rating of 10 (5,900 XP). A <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=NWE2NjRlYWZmMGVm ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>greater restoration</a></em> spell restores the lich’s memory and all of its spells. Another casting of the spell restores its normal hit point maximum (135).<br><br>If the characters restore its memory, the lich gives them the passwords to all the locked doors in the Amber Temple (with the exception of the door into area X28, where its phylactery is hidden). It also provides all the information pertaining to Strahd and the temple presented at the start of this chapter. If the characters think to ask, it provides them with the command words for any of the books in the library (area K30).<br><br>If the characters restore its body, it offers to escort them while they explore the temple. The other creatures that inhabit the temple don’t threaten the characters as long as the lich is with them.<br><br>The lich defends itself if attacked and turns to dust if it is reduced to 0 hit points.<br><br>The lich assumes that the characters have come seeking knowledge and power. If it is inclined to help them, it tells them how the amber sarcophagi work (as explained in the “<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NjUzMDkyMGFmZmFj ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Amber Sarcophagi</a>” handout). The lich has no alliance with or animosity toward Strahd, and no interest in challenging Strahd for control of Barovia.<br><br>The furnishings here are in poor condition and fall apart easily.<br><br>There are three secret doors in this room. The secret door to area X28 has an <em>arcane lock</em> spell cast on it. The password to suppress the spell is “Exethanter.”<br><br><h4>Treasure</h4>The lich’s ancient, bronze-covered spellbook sits on a rotted divan, in plain view. Inscribed on its spine is a title: <em>The Incants of Exethanter</em>. The spellbook contains all the spells on the lich’s list of prepared spells. The lich attacks anyone who tries to take its spellbook.<br><br><hr><br><h3>X28. Hidden Phylactery</h3>The secret door to this room has an <em>arcane lock</em> spell cast on it (see area X27 for details).<br><br><blockquote>Behind the secret door is a small, dusty room. Rising from the floor in the eastern half of the room is a scaly arm and claw clutching a small box made of bone.</blockquote><br>The scaly arm is merely a carved pedestal. The bone box is Exethanter’s phylactery. If it takes 20 or more radiant damage from a single source, the phylactery is destroyed.<br><br><hr><br><h3>X29. Secret Room</h3><br><blockquote>Dust and cobwebs fill this otherwise empty room.</blockquote><br>The ceiling here is 10 feet high.<br><br><hr><br><h3>X30. Preserved Library</h3><blockquote>This stone library has twenty-foot-high walls and a thirty-foot-high vaulted ceiling. Covering the ceiling is a fresco that depicts angels being set ablaze in a hell. A black marble railing encloses a gold marble staircase that spirals gently down a thirty-foot-wide, thirty-foot-deep shaft to the north. Against the gray walls stand six ten-foot-tall, black marble bookcases. On their shelves are hundreds of well-preserved tomes.

Peering over the railing reveals crates in that area.<br><br>There are no ladders here to reach the high bookshelves.

Entry</h3>Read the following text if the characters approach from the courtyard (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NTZhOGQwMTVjZmM4 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K1</a>):<br><br><blockquote>The ornate outer doors of the castle hang open, flanked by fluttering torches in iron sconces. Twenty feet inside the castle is a second set of doors.</blockquote><br>If one or more characters approach from <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NTZhOGQwMTVjZmM4 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K1</a> and come within 10 feet of the double doors, read:<br><br><blockquote>The doors in front of you suddenly swing open, revealing a grand hall filled with the sound of organ music.</blockquote><br>If the characters approach from area K8 and have not yet visited this area, read:<br><br><blockquote>A set of double doors to the west appears to be, or to lead to, an exit from the castle.</blockquote><br>If the characters enter from either direction, read:<br><br><blockquote>Overhead, in the vaulted entry foyer, four statues of dragons glare down, their eyes flickering in the torchlight.</blockquote><br>If anyone except Strahd enters this area through the doors that adjoin area K8, the dragons come alive, drop to the floor hissing and spitting, and attack. The dragons don’t attack characters who enter this area from <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NTZhOGQwMTVjZmM4 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K1</a>, heading east. The dragons are four <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NzAxM2FkZTU3N2M5 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>red dragon wyrmlings</a></strong>, and they have instructions to allow guests to enter the castle, but not to leave it. If intruders vacate this area, the dragons fly up to their perches and revert to stone. In their stone forms, they are impervious to weapon damage. The dragons never leave the room.<br><br><hr><br><h3>K8. Great Entry</h3><blockquote>Cobwebs stretch between the columns that support the vaulted ceiling of a great, dusty hall dimly lit by sputtering torches in iron sconces. The torches cast odd shadows across the faces of eight stone gargoyles squatting motionlessly on the rim of the domed ceiling. Cracked and faded ceiling frescoes are covered by decay.<br><br>Double doors of bronze stand closed to the east. To the north, a wide staircase climbs into darkness. A lit hallway to the south contains another set of bronze doors, through which you hear sad and majestic organ tones.</blockquote><br>The southern hallway is described in area K9. The wide staircase leads up to area K19.<br><br>If the characters are here by invitation, add the following:<br><br><blockquote>An elf with brown skin and long black hair descends the wide staircase, quiet as a cat. He wears a gray cloak over black studded leather armor and has a polished scimitar hanging from his belt. “My master is expecting you,” he says.</blockquote> <br>The elf is <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=M2NlY2IzOWI5Nzhi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Rahadin</a></strong>, the castle chamberlain. He fights only if attacked. Otherwise, he leads the characters to the dining hall (area K10), points them inside, pulls the doors shut behind them, and withdraws to <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YWUwMjk4ZDM0NDI1 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K72</a> by way of the South Tower Stair (area K21).<br><br><h4>Development</h4>After all the characters leave this room, the eight <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTc0YTgyMjA1NDJj ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>gargoyles</a></strong> attack any character who dares to return. The gargoyles also swoop down to fight if they are attacked. When the gargoyles attack, the turbulence in the air from their wings extinguishes the feeble torches in the sconces, plunging the hall into darkness unless the characters have light sources.<br><br><hr><br><h3>K9. Guests’ Hall</h3><blockquote>Torchlight flutters against the walls of this vaulted hall. To the east, an arched hallway stretches for twenty feet, ending at a spiral staircase that goes up and down. Next to the hallway, a suit of armor, oiled and glistening, stands at attention in a shallow alcove. To the west, large double doors hang slightly open, and a steady bright light escapes through the opening. Swells of organ music come from behind the doors, spilling their melody of power and defeat into the hall.</blockquote><br>The suit of armor standing in the alcove is merely a normal suit of plate armor that is well cared for.<br><br>The staircase leads down to <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YWUwMjk4ZDM0NDI1 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K61</a> and up to <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=Yjc3NTVkZDRiZmEz ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K30</a>. The double doors provide access to area K10.<br><br><hr><br><h3>K10. Dining Hall</h3>The first time the characters enter this room, read:<br><br><blockquote>Three enormous crystal chandeliers brilliantly illuminate this magnificent chamber. Pillars of stone stand against dull white marble walls, supporting the ceiling. In the center of the room, a long, heavy table is covered with a fine white satin cloth. The table is laden with many delectable foods: roasted beast basted in a savory sauce, roots and herbs of every taste, and sweet fruits and vegetables. Places are set for each of you with fine, delicate china and silver. At each place is a crystal goblet filled with an amber liquid with a delicate, tantalizing fragrance.<br><br>At the center of the far west wall, between floor-to-ceiling mirrors, stands a massive organ. Its pipes blare out a thunderous melody that speaks in its tone of greatness and despair. Seated at the organ, facing away from you, a single caped figure pounds the keys in raptured ecstasy. The figure suddenly stops, and as a deep silence falls over the dining hall, it slowly turns toward you.</blockquote><br>Reveal <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YjM5YWNjZTgxMWNh ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Handout: Area K10</a> when the players enter this room.<br><br>The figure is an illusion of Strahd. It welcomes the characters and invites them to dine. The illusion acts like <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTZiYzA5N2ViNTZi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Strahd</a> and plays the part of the gracious host, speaking kindly and telling the characters that they’re free to explore the castle. “Strahd” might talk about his family or shed light on the castle’s history, but the illusion provides no useful information about the castle’s inhabitants, treasures, or dangers other than to say that the castle doesn’t receive many guests. The illusory vampire converses with the characters for no more than 3 rounds, never moving from the organ bench. When the time is up, or if the illusion is attacked, it simply disappears with a mocking laugh.<br><br>The moment the figure disappears, a fierce, bone-chilling wind rises up and roars through the hall, putting out all open flames. The characters hear the screech of ancient hinges and the solid thud of many heavy doors slamming shut, one after another, into the distance. They also hear the portcullis clang shut and the tired groan of the aged drawbridge pulling up. Finally, unless the doors to this room are being held open, they slam shut (but do not lock). If the characters open the doors, they see that all the torches in areas K7, K8, and K9 have gone out.<br><br>The organ appears locked in place and immovable, but a character who makes a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check notices scratch marks on the floor that suggest that the organ can be slid outward. A character who tries pushing various keys and pedals discovers that one of the pedals, when depressed, causes the organ to slide outward about 2 feet, allowing access to a secret door in the back wall that swings open into area K11. Because this secret door is hidden behind the organ, it can’t be found and opened until the organ is moved out of the way.<br><br>The food on the table is tasty, the wine delicious.<br><br><hr><br><h3>K11. South Archers’ Post</h3><blockquote>The castle courtyard is visible through arrow slits in the north and west walls. Leaning against the walls are mirrors of various sizes, some as tall as a human and others small enough to fit in a backpack.</blockquote><br>Each arrow slit is 2½ feet tall and 4 inches wide. The framed mirrors (seventeen in all) used to hang on various walls of the castle. Strahd had them taken down and stored here.<br><br>A secret door in the east wall can be pulled open to reveal the back of the pipe organ in area K10. Characters can’t pass through the secret door while the organ is blocking it, and the organ can’t be moved from this side.<br><br><hr><br><h3>K12. Turret Post</h3><blockquote>A high, domed ceiling caps the thirty-foot-wide octagonal room before you. Frescoes faded with age adorn the ceiling, but their images are impossible to make out. Tall, thin arrow slits look out over the courtyard.</blockquote><br>Each arrow slit is 2½ feet tall and 4 inches wide.<br><br><hr><br><h3>K13. Turret Post Access Hall</h3><blockquote>This long, narrow corridor runs east to west. Cobwebs fill the hall, obstructing sight beyond a few feet.</blockquote><br><hr><br><h3>K14. Hall of Faith</h3><blockquote>This grand hall is choked with dust and stretches into darkness ahead. Webs hang from the arched ceiling like drapes, and life-sized statues of knights line the hallway on both sides, their eyes seeming to watch you.</blockquote><br>The statues are harmless. Their moving eyes are a simple optical illusion.<br><br>Double doors stand at both ends of the hall. Above the doors leading to area K15 hangs a symbol of beaten bronze that looks like a rising or setting sun.<br><br><hr><br><h3>K15. Chapel</h3><blockquote>Dim, colored light filters through tall, broken, and boarded-up windows of stained glass, illuminating the ancient chapel of Ravenloft. A few bats flutter about near the top of the ninety-foot-high domed ceiling. A balcony runs the length of the west wall, fifty feet above the floor. In the center of the balcony, two dark shapes are slumped in tall chairs.<br><br>Benches coated with centuries of dust lie about the floor in jumbled disarray. Beyond this debris, lit by a piercing shaft of light, an altar stands upon a stone platform. The sides of the altar are carved with bas-reliefs of angelic figures entwined with grape vines. The light from above falls directly on a silver statuette. A cloaked figure is draped over the altar, and a black mace lies on the floor near its feet.</blockquote><br>The figure slumped on the altar is all that remains of Gustav Herrenghast, a lawful evil human cleric who tried to obtain the <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YWI1ZGNiMjY2MjVl ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Icon of Ravenloft</a></em> and did not survive the attempt. See “Treasure” below for more information on the icon and Gustav’s possessions.<br><br>A sculpted stone railing cordons off the upstairs balcony, which is described in <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=Yjc3NTVkZDRiZmEz ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K28</a>.<br><br><h4>Treasure</h4>The statuette on the altar is an artifact called the <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YWI1ZGNiMjY2MjVl ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Icon of Ravenloft</a></em>. Any evil creature that touches the statuette must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 88 (16d10) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The statuette is safe for all creatures to handle once it is no longer in contact with the altar.<br><br>Gustav’s corpse wears a handsome, fur-lined black cloak embroidered with golden thread (worth 250 gp) and a suit of chain mail, both nonmagical. Gustav’s black mace is a <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MGY3NTI3ZTgyMjEz ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>mace of terror</a></em>.<br><br><h4><span style=\"background-color: rgb( 255 , 255 , 255 ) ; color: rgb( 99 , 36 , 35 )\">Fortunes of Ravenloft</span></h4>If your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it lies on the floor behind the altar.<br><br>If your card reading indicates an encounter with <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTZiYzA5N2ViNTZi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Strahd</a> in this area, he is among the bats fluttering below the ceiling or he is standing at one end of the chapel—a dark shape in the vast hall.<br><br><hr><br><h3>K16. North Chapel Access</h3><blockquote>This arched room connects a vast chamber to the east and a staircase that rises to the west. Alcoves in the north and south walls hold eight-foot-tall sculptures of helmed knights with muscular builds. Black shadows fall across their faces.</blockquote><br>The statues are harmless. The vast chamber to the east is the chapel (area K15). The staircase to the west is described in <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=Yjc3NTVkZDRiZmEz ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K29</a>.<br><br><hr><br><h3>K17. South Chapel Access</h3><blockquote>This arched room connects a vast chamber to the east and the landing of a staircase to the west. To the left of the landing, the stairs curl down into darkness. To the right, the stairs climb into thick drapes of cobwebs. Alcoves in the north and south walls hold eight-foot-tall sculptures of helmed knights with bright blades. Black shadows obscure their faces.</blockquote><br>The statues are harmless. The vast chamber to the east is the chapel (area K15). The staircase to the west is described in area K18.<br><br><hr><br><h3>K18. High Tower Staircase</h3><blockquote>The large flagstones of this spiraling staircase lead up and down around a twenty-foot-wide stone core. Cobwebs fill the staircase, making it difficult to see even the ceiling. Heavy beams sag overhead from centuries of supporting weight.</blockquote><br>The staircase starts at <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YzI0YTFjYTVjY2Jh ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K84</a> and spirals upward around a central shaft (area K18a), climbing 300 feet to the top of the high tower (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=M2JjYzQ4NTk1NjM1 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K59</a>).<br><br>A recently constructed masonry wall blocks the staircase 10 feet below the landing west of area K17. A chink in this wall allows gas (or a vampire in gaseous form) to pass from one side of the wall to the other. A character who inspects the wall closely can spot the chink with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check. The wall is too sturdy for characters to knock down, but they can create a hole wide enough to crawl through in 1 hour, or reduce the entire wall to a pile of masonry bricks and rubble in 2 hours.<br><br>Thirty feet below the masonry wall and 50 feet above the foot of the steps, a small crack has formed in the outer wall of the stairwell. The crack is 1/2 inch wide, 5 inches tall, and 12 inches deep; it leads to the castle’s wine cellar (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YWUwMjk4ZDM0NDI1 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K63</a>). Characters can notice the crack automatically as they climb or descend the stairs. Widening the crack enough to squeeze through the wall requires major excavation and would take several days.<br><br>The shaft that these stairs wrap around (area K18a) runs vertically from <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=M2JjYzQ4NTk1NjM1 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K59</a> to <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YzI0YTFjYTVjY2Jh ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K84</a> without any holes or obstructions. The inner wall of the stairwell, between the staircase and the shaft, is solid.<br><br><hr><br><h3>K18a. High Tower Shaft</h3>Characters can access this 10-foot-diameter, 390-foot-tall stone shaft from the top or the bottom of the high tower (areas <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=M2JjYzQ4NTk1NjM1 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>K59</a> and <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YzI0YTFjYTVjY2Jh ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>K84</a>, respectively).<br><br>The shaft is dark and choked with cobwebs. A rushing wind causes the webs to stir. Climbing the shaft is impossible without the aid of magic or the use of a climber’s kit, since there are few handholds.<br><br>The bats in the catacombs (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YzI0YTFjYTVjY2Jh ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K84</a>) fly up the shaft at night, exiting Castle Ravenloft through various arrow slits and holes in the tower’s peak (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=M2JjYzQ4NTk1NjM1 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K59</a>). After feeding, they return by the same route.<br><br><hr><br><h3>K19. Grand Landing</h3><blockquote>Massive stairs rise to a landing twenty feet wide by forty feet long. Stone arches support a ceiling covered with frescoes twenty feet overhead. The frescoes depict armored knights on horseback, their finer features faded beyond recognition.<br><br>Dust floats in the air here. At each end of the south wall, a staircase rises into darkness. Between the staircases are twin alcoves, each one containing a standing suit of armor covered with dark stains. Each suit of armor clutches a mace, the “business end” of which is shaped like a dragon’s head. Words engraved on the arches above the suits of armor have been scratched out.</blockquote><br>Both staircases on the south wall climb to <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=Yjc3NTVkZDRiZmEz ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K25</a>. The massive stairs lead down to area K8. Anyone who crosses in front of the alcoves along the south wall activates the suits of armor.<br><br>Both suits of armor are mechanical traps, each one activated by a pressure plate hidden in the floor in front of its alcove. A character who searches for traps in one of these locations notices both pressure plates with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check.<br><br>When 40 or more pounds of weight are placed on a pressure plate, the suit of armor nearest to that plate springs forward, flailing its arms and wielding its mace. Any creature standing on a pressure plate when its trap triggers must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage from the flailing armor. After leaping out and attacking, the armor retracts. The pressure plate resets after 1 minute, after which its armor trap can be triggered again.<br><br>The suits of armor act much like metal puppets—a little joke intended to spook visitors more than damage them. A pressure plate can be disabled by a character who uses thieves’ tools and makes a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. A trap can also be disabled by destroying its suit of armor, which has AC 18, 5 hit points, and immunity to psychic and poison damage.<br><br><hr><br><h3>K20. Heart of Sorrow</h3><blockquote>A mosaic floor adds a touch of color to the otherwise dark, cold, empty tower that rises above you. A spiral staircase rises slowly into darkness, hugging the outer wall. In the center of the room, another set of stairs leads down.</blockquote><br>Reveal <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=OWJhYjlhYTUzMDg2 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Handout: Area K20</a> when the characters enter this area.<br><br>The staircase in the center of the floor (area K20a) leads down to <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YWUwMjk4ZDM0NDI1 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K71</a>.<br><br>The spiral staircase has no railing and connects the main floor of the castle with each level above it. First, the staircase climbs 50 feet to a landing (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=Yjc3NTVkZDRiZmEz ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>shown on map 4</a>), from which an open archway leads to area K13. East of that opening is a secret door that conceals a ladder leading down to <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=Yjc3NTVkZDRiZmEz ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K34</a>.<br><br>The stairs ascend another 40 feet to another landing (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZTM3NDAwZGFhNGE5 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>shown on map 5</a>), with archways that lead to <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZTM3NDAwZGFhNGE5 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>areas K45 and K46</a>, and then climb another 100 feet to a landing beneath the tower’s heart (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=M2JjYzQ4NTk1NjM1 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>shown on map 8</a>). The staircase wraps around the heart, ending at the top of the tower (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=M2JjYzQ4NTk1NjM1 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K60</a>).<br><br><h4>The Heart</h4>The tower, including the spiral staircase, is alive. When the characters set foot on the staircase for the first time, read:<br><br><blockquote>As you step onto the spiral staircase, a reddish light flares high overhead, then settles into a dull, pulsing red glow. You now see the full immensity of this tower. The spiral staircase circles up the tower’s full height. The tower, sixty feet wide at its base, becomes narrower as it climbs. At the pinnacle of the hollow tower, a large crystal heart pulsates with red light. Above the heart, the stairs continue upward.</blockquote><br>Have the characters and the Heart of Sorrow roll initiative. If the characters leave the tower and later return, they can reroll initiative, but the heart’s initiative count doesn’t change.<br><br>The awakened tower shakes and pitches on the Heart of Sorrow’s initiative count. Any creature on the stairs or hanging on a tower wall at the start of the heart’s turn must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall to the base of the tower. Characters who are crawling on the staircase or who lie prone on the stairs succeed automatically.<br><br>The Heart of Sorrow is a 10-foot-diameter red crystal heart that floats near the top of the tower. Characters standing on the nearby stairs can make melee attacks against the heart, provided their weapons have a reach of at least 10 feet. The glass heart has AC 15 and 50 hit points. If the heart is reduced to 0 hit points, it shatters, and its crystal shards transform into blood, which rains down on the tower interior and staircase. The destruction of the Heart of Sorrow causes the tower to stop shuddering, and the interior of the tower becomes dark. Destroying the heart earns the characters 1,500 XP.<br><br><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTZiYzA5N2ViNTZi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Strahd</a> and the Heart of Sorrow are connected, such that any damage Strahd takes is transferred to the heart. If the heart absorbs damage that drops it to 0 hit points, it is destroyed, and Strahd takes any leftover damage. The Heart of Sorrow regains all its hit points at dawn if it has at least 1 hit point remaining.<br><br>The Heart of Sorrow is held aloft by the will of Strahd. Casting <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=MGIwMTBiN2M3ODM2 ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i>dispel magic</a></em> on it has no effect.<br><br><strong><em>Animated Halberds.</em></strong> Mounted on the walls along the section of staircase nearest the heart are ten <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MWMyMjJlYTQ4ZGM5 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>animated halberds</a></strong>. The halberds attack any creature that threatens the Heart of Sorrow.<br><br><strong><em>Vampire Spawn.</em></strong> Strahd senses if any damage is done to the Heart of Sorrow and sends four <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YWM4NmJjYmJiMGE1 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>vampire spawn</a></strong> to destroy those responsible. These vampire spawn are former adventurers whom Strahd defeated long ago. They use their Spider Climb feature to scuttle along the tower walls and arrive in 3 rounds.<br><br><hr><br><h3>K20a.

Servants’ Entrance</h3><blockquote>Dim light filters in through a dust-caked window in the east wall. A door next to the window leads to the castle’s northeast courtyard.<br><br>Everything in this room is coated with dust, including a large, heavy table in the center of the floor. A thick book lies open on a desk, with an inkwell and a quill next to it. There is a broken door in the north wall, and a staircase in the south wall plunges into darkness. On each side of the staircase, a skeletal figure draped in gleaming chain mail stands sagging at attention, holding a rusty halberd.</blockquote><br>The skeletons, which were assembled by <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NGE3OWU5NGU0Zjli ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Cyrus Belview</a> (see <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YWUwMjk4ZDM0NDI1 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area K62</a>), are held together with wire frames and hung on pegs.

Drinking that Darkness from the soil, a Blight carries out the will of ancient evil and attempts to spread that evil wherever it can.<br><b style=\"font-style: italic\"></b><br><b style=\"font-style: italic\">Roots of the Gulthias Tree.</b> Legends tell of a vampire named Gulthias who worked terrible magic and raised up an abominable tower called Nightfang Spire. Gulthias was undone when a hero plunged a wooden stake through his heart, but as the vampire was destroyed, his blood infused the stake with a dreadful power. In time, tendrils of new growth sprouted from the wood, growing into a sapling infused with the vampire’s evil essence. It is said that a mad druid discovered the sapling, transplanting it to an underground grotto where it could grow. From this Gulthias tree came the seeds from which the first blights were sown.<br><br><strong><em>Dark Conquest.</em></strong> Wherever a tree or plant is contaminated by a fragment of an evil mind or power, a Gulthias tree can rise to infest and corrupt the surrounding forest. Its evil spreads through root and soil to other plants, which perish or transform into blights. As those blights spread, they poison and uproot healthy plants, replacing them with brambles, toxic weeds, and others of their kind. In time, an infestation of blights can turn any land or forest into a place of corruption.<br><br>In forests infested with blights, trees and plants grow with supernatural speed. Vines and undergrowth rapidly spread through buildings and overrun trails and roads. After blights have killed or driven off their inhabitants, whole villages can disappear in the space of days.<br><br><strong><em>Controlled by Evil.</em></strong> Blights are independent creatures, but most act under a Gulthias tree’s control, often displaying the habits and traits of the life force or spirit that spawned them. By attacking their progenitor’s old foes or seeking out treasures valuable to it, they carry on the legacy of long-lost evil.<br>","img":""}
